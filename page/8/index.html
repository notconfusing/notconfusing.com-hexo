<iframe src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_rN-bnvxOfM" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Here’s how I structured the game, and how you could build from it.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game pieces consisted of 3 sizes of circles at 2.5cm 5cm and 8cm radii.</li>
<li>I was experimenting with the right point attribution for each. As shown the point values are 1, 3, and 8 respectively.</li>
<li><p>The maps were drawn by Anca Mosoiu of <a href="http://techliminal.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">TechLiminal</a>, and included the standard square, the African continent, and a silhouette of a meditating Buddha (pictured).<br><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Participants compete head-to-head,</p>
</li>
<li>and are given 30-seconds,</li>
<li>to lay down non-overlapping circles,</li>
<li>within the drawn boundary.</li>
<li><p>The competitor with the most points on the board at the end of the time wins.<br><strong>Results:</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>I tried to make the optimal strategy counter-intuitive which was to use the smallest pieces only. The ratio of points as I mentioned is: <em>1, 3, 8</em>. If you calculate the ratio of area for each circle and normalize to the smallest circle you have ratios: <em>1, 4, 10.24</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>If we divide these ratios. we receive <em>1, .75, .78125</em> which approximate the decreasing return that I wanted to achieve.</li>
<li>Children were competitive with adults. One child whose age meant that he could not spell his own name, showed fantastic geometric reasoning and opted for the mostly 1’s strategy. Yet surprisingly only one competitor realized that all-1’s not only gave the best points per area, but were also the easiest to pack.<br><strong>Next steps:</strong><br>Create a new set of circles in which whose points per area ratios are increasing rather than decreasing, and give contestants more time 1 minute perhaps? What would you change?</li>
</ul>

        <p>iSchool at Berkeley was a department I revered during my time there lurking in the backs of lecture rooms for special events and timidly knocking on Professor doors, which is why I was so honoured when they <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/newsandevents/events/ias/20120824" target="_blank" rel="external">invited me to guest-speak at the infamous Friday Seminar</a>. On August 24th 2012, in front of 20 attendees I talked about my latest passion, creating bidirectional links between Wikipedia and other online databases by <em>link reciprocation. </em> <a href="http://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/institut/personen/petras" target="_blank" rel="external">Vivian Petras</a> gave a suitable opening talk about Europeana language problems form a half-technical perspective, which made a suitable segue into my talk, “Data Archipelago.”</p>
<p><a href="http://notconfusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/islandhoppingstructurethumb.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://notconfusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/islandhoppingstructurethumb-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="islandhoppingstructurethumb"></a></p>
<p>Unknowing on how much to delve into details of still-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/VIAFbot" target="_blank" rel="external">in-review</a> <a href="https://github.com/notconfusing/VIAFbot" target="_blank" rel="external">VIAFbot</a>, I attempted to strike a middle ground by describing how VIAFbot would work, and subsequently what that could mean for the future of connecting what I call <em>Data Islands</em>. The method that I propose in this talk is the <em>link reciprocation</em> technique, whereby an algorithm follows links going into Wikipedia then reflects and reciprocates those links back out to the initiating site. This imitates a <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Topology.html" target="_blank" rel="external">bidirectional linking structure</a>, which the ultimate loser in a hot debate in the creation of the web circa 1990.  A stand-out, Wikipedia always kept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:What_links_here" target="_blank" rel="external">bidirectional linking in its internal structure</a>, but could not by itself  implement this type of link between the exterior Data Islands.  Given VIAFbot’s hacked-way of making these cross-site bidirectional links we could create new ways to determine not only our interests, but topics in the intersection of our interests of which we were previously unaware (slides 40-46). As an analogy, I aimed to show that there were practical ways to create informational seaplanes to island-hop what I am creating and terming the <em>Data Archipelago</em>.</p>

        <p>Searching through my draft blogs I find that the earliest is un-annotated, but prophetic collection of quotes I compiled in 2011. They are from Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs biography, that too-strong dose of propaganda that turned me off of the mystique of supposedly messianic  technology. (Perhaps I don’t give enough weight to the fact that it was the first and last book that I read entirely on a laptop). I admit I was - and still am - wooed by the allure of technolust, but at that moment, I stopped seeing computational progress as a deliverance and started seeing it blunt tool, often overdressed.</p>
<p>Ironically it was Bill Gate’s quotes in this book that dislodged and set in motion the changing of paradigms. (Of course at this time, it still took a white man’s voice to get me to hear it). Graciously, when asked what he thought about the iPad 2, Gates quipped “Here I am, merely saving the world from malaria and that sort of thing, and Steve is still coming up with amazing new products.” The bite of this sarcasm shattered the coordinates of my reality. We still have malaria to eradicate! A marketing  tech trends seems insignificant in this context.</p>
<p>I couldn’t have forseen it then, but 5 years later it’s inevitable that this summer I am working at <a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">Data Science for Social Good (DSSG)</a>, the “University of Chicago summer program to train aspiring data scientists to work on data mining, machine learning, big data, and data science projects with social impact.” The fit is perfect, I am shoulder to shoulder with challenging colleagues who have as much penchant for the command line as desire to address human problems non-paternal ways.</p>
<p>Specifically my team’s charge these 12 weeks is to partner with <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/project/predicting-students-that-will-struggle-academically-by-third-grade/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tulsa Public Schools to better predict which 3rd graders are likely not to pass reading proficiency tests</a>. Armed with the school data of Oklahomans aged 4-9, the goal is to help struggling students as early as Kindergarten, by suggesting which programs will likely improve their reading the most.</p>
<p>Perhaps what’s most impressive to me about the DSSG organization is their healthy skepticism and introspection. There are weekly required discussion sections around the ethics of data science. Here  The questions top of are in the vein of whether <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">“approaching the world as a software problem is a category error that has led us into some terrible habits of mind?” and if “machine learning is like money laundering for bias.”</a></p>
<p>The unresolved dilemma which I dealt with this week, was the way to handle student’s grades as data in our prediction problem. I asked a colleague of mine who is working on another education project how she was treating grade data. The obvious thing to do, she responded, was GPA calculation, plus numeric counts of each letter earned. She was working at a High School level, but our early primary school students are so young that I take issue extracting meaning out of their academic “performance”. This issue stems from the way that grades personally (dis)served me growing up. I felt that they were artificial switches I was meant to manipulate, completely disconnected with education.  In some way I don’t want to reify the power of the grade algorithmically. On the other hand we want the most accurate models, to best help our students. I’ve decided to take a cue from the team <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/07/19/486499835/can-big-data-help-head-off-police-misconduct" target="_blank" rel="external">working to identify police offers likely to have adverse incidents with the public</a> who have chosen not to include race as an attribute in their model, and eschew GPA for the time being.</p>
<p>Still, I’ll acknowledge my privilege to be able to join a Gates-style tech-for-good crusade this summer.  I read more now into his 2011  Forbes interview: “The metric of success is lives saved, kids who aren’t crippled,” says Gates. “Which is slightly different than units sold, profits achieved. But it’s all very measurable, and you can set ambitious goals and see how you do.” The ambitious goals have been set at DSSG, now there are 5 weeks left to see how we do.</p>

        <p>Killer Features: The Vitality of Piracy Cultures</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>University of California, Berkeley</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As experienced facilitators of an undergraduate discussion course on The Politics of Piracy, the authors are uniquely positioned to contribute analyses of several, specific Piracy Cultures. Questions about the relationships between content creators and consumers are posed to two self-identified pirates, each members of piracy groups. The results indicate creator-consumer relationships are present, but are merely one in a set of crucial motivations for piracy–elements herein called killer features. One case study delves into the world of LUElinks, a private linksharing community that is as much social network as media provider. The other explores the world of BakaBT and anime communities which exist in large part through shared “fansubs”–peer-produced, superior translations of sometimes unlicensed Japanese animation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keywords: Media Piracy, Piracy Cultures, Social Networks, Anime, Fansub, Killer Features, Creator-Consumer Relationship, Communities of Practice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider piracy. Consider the pirates. They are the digital citizens and deviants that operate outside the set confines of institutional rules. While their actions are unbound, they bond together in outsider status, inevitably creating their own cultures as they go. These cultures are not typically inspected. There is a boundary between the Piracy Cultures and the corporate cultures of the media industry. Typically we inspect the shape and movements of the institutionalized industry to see its influence on the gate between the two camps. Yet symmetrically, there exists another vantage point on this divide: the shape and movement of Piracy Cultures. Focusing on Piracy Cultures is an opportunity to dust away questions of legality and examine the piracy–and pirates–for what they are worth, for what they might tell us about the future condition of that border between the media organizations’ domain, and the space exterior.</p>
<p>At UC Berkeley the border of the student-instructor dynamic has been breached. Undergraduates, through a long-running program, have the opportunity to initiate and facilitate credit-bearing courses. One such course is Politics of Piracy, through which the authors have critically examined piracy as discussion leaders. Author one facilitated the course for four semesters until Fall 2010 and Author two facilitated for the second time this Spring 2011, a total of four years between them. The authors hold unique positions as student-scholars. They are close to many piracy practitioners: some students enrolled in the course and some student-pirates outside the classroom. Additionally they have immersed themselves in the academic field, steeped in piracy research and current events.</p>
<p>A recent landmark event was the release of Media Piracy in Emerging Economies a report by the Social Sciences Research Council (2011). Summarily they found that “piracy is better conceived as a failure of affordable access to media in legal markets.” While claiming that affordability stands as one of the main tenets to subvert legality in acquiring media, they fail to complete the thought. The Social Sciences Research Council (2011) declares that “increasingly, commercial pirates face the same dilemma as the legal industry: how to compete with free” (p. 53) in their analysis of organized crime’s role in piracy. This would suggest that resellers of pirated content are contending with legitimate distribution on the linear factor of pricing, that the end consumer’s choice is simply a function of money. Yet this curiously arrives at a contradiction, as resellers have not yet become extinct everywhere. As a distribution channel, they must add some incentive to purchase the media in order for their business to exist, even if only geographic convenience. Likewise, the authors of this paper contend “piracy as distribution” possesses (in a re-branding of the popular marketing buzzwords) killer features that differentiate piracy in the spectrum of all available options. Some of those distinguishing features have been analyzed through the lens of the economic concept of commons-based peer-production.</p>
<p>In The Wealth of Networks, Yochai Benkler (2006) attempts to understand disparate practices of production that challenge canonical economic precepts.  Benkler gives an engineering view of peer-to-peer file-sharing (including piracy) as, “a highly efficient system for storing and accessing data in a computer network.” This is a useful interpretation since it too shaves away legality to approach more essential qualities of a dynamic, rich set of solutions. Further, it encourages an approach Benkler purports throughout his work–to examine critically an unfamiliar or seemingly inexplicable system (with respect to networks) as a creative innovation. The creative innovation while lauded by forward-thinkers, is not an instantly accepted salvation for all, it is subject to what regulators may think of it. They are less likely to be impressed by clever coding alone.</p>
<p>The regulatory literature comprehends piracy in its relation to copyright expansion as the bolstering of exclusive rights regimes made successful through policy change enabled by industry lobbying. Lawrence Lessig’s Free Culture includes an apt metaphor of the narrative of a long-term, unsuccessful foray into both federal lawsuits and policy reform on copyright (2004). Being 2011 today, seven years distant, one witnesses significant changes in piracy and social use of the internet. A more recent legal work by Annemarie Bridy (2009) expresses the further compounding frustration of both public and private regulatory practices. Bridy analyzes the issues of regulation and enforcement up until today, emphasizing a failure of the regulation of goods, networks, and user behavior in a manifest self-regulation in the user.</p>
<p>Burdensome regulation has meant that in order to make distribution work for digital goods, large, influential organizations are needed. The complexity of regulation dictates that any satisfying solution will have large overhead, and the organizations have looked to create design and user experience attractions to make palatable the passing of that overhead. As an example, Blythe, Mark and Wright recommend the music industry drop intimidation and embrace enchantment (2008)–a distinctly affective strategy reminiscent of Apple’s “environment” model, and of course, iTunes, the generally lauded “gatekeeper” of music (Wingfield 2007). Other examples include Google Books, which provides an equivalent analogy for the publishing industry. An example closer to our research is the praised Steam, a stand-alone distribution software for computer games (Gambotto-Burke 2007).</p>
<p>With a growing number of increasingly elaborate digital gatekeepers, one of the internet’s original promises of disintermediation is broken. As outlined by Brown and Duguid (2000) in The Social Life of Information, disintermediation in an increasingly networked society is far from clear. It is argued that a future of disintermediation is a myth. The institutions that lay between the creator and the consumer are not shrinking, and are perhaps expanding. Even if institutions were disintermediating, Brown and Duguid (2000) explain that “it requires a profoundly naive belief in disitermediation to assume that all links that fall between […] are somehow interference in the information channel” (p. 6). The chains of connections that are the information channel from creator to consumer are not simply resistors with each additional link contributing more impedance in the institutional frameworks. But is the same true for information channels outside of the official media intermediaries, for those in Piracy Cultures?</p>
<p>Given the various approaches to piracy in the academic literature, the authors have discerned that few take on the perspective of understanding the relationship at the core of this issue of Piracy. The creation and exchange of goods, examined as a black box, takes place between creator and consumer. There is some relationship that exists, however mediated, between the originators of some good, and the consumer or end-user. Investigating Piracy Cultures from the hinterland of the pirate’s perspective, to which the authors have a rare point of entry, elucidates valuable understandings of this underlying relationship. On the other hand, research revealed the relationship between creators and consumers, while evident, is merely one in a range of crucial, killer features existing in and of Piracy Cultures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The research questions at the outset of this paper were: In Piracy Cultures, how important is the relationship between content creator and consumer? What does this relationship look like? How does this play out through intermediaries? How do pirates consider or deal with the issue of compensation?</p>
<p>Through posing these questions, the suggestion is made that there is value in understanding the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof) between content creators and consumers since it is the fundamental, underlying issue of all forms of piracy. Understanding more fully how some Piracy Cultures view and practice this relationship will thus help inform our general understandings of piracy, which has implications for the role of institutionalized markets, suggests insights into perceptions of policy, and begins to address the question of whether piracy will remain a perpetual counter-culture.</p>
<p>The hypothesis held prior to research was that in Piracy Cultures, pirates feel a closer connection to content creators than they do through institutionalized markets. It is put forth that piracy could bring creators and consumers together rather than obscure or destroy obligations between them; they form a closer peer-to-peer relationship, so to speak.</p>
<p>The research was conducted through separate, semi-structured interviews with two self-described pirates who currently maintain membership to piracy groups. Each was asked a common set of questions and asked additional follow up questions as topics arose out of their responses. Questions focused on three main areas, in order: the facts of their content consumption, details and practices concerning Piracy Cultures around content consumption, and their relationship with content creators.</p>
<p>The interviewees had not previously shared their personal experiences with the authors. Hence, our interviews were the first time they had discussed explicitly (in any amount of detail) the culture and practices of themselves and their Piracy Cultures with respect to academic research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Study #1 - Melinda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the last few years, Melinda joined LUElinks, a private social networking website with an active message board, a member-created site-wide poll each day, and a healthy database of links to material (including software, games, video, photos, and audio), aggregated so members of the board can locate and reproduce the content, often without the permission of copyright holder(s). According to Melinda, these links typically come from cloud storage services, most prominently MegaUpload. Melinda is active on LUElinks to this day, reading and posting on the various message boards and downloading content located through the site’s links, especially movies and documentaries. Additionally, she has come to develop an interest in the masses of unlicensed images and pictures posted on the message boards. However, she rarely uploads content, citing a few cases in which she discovered some content had not already been shared. She proceeded to pirate the material through a torrent, upload to MegaUpload, and, finally, enter a new link in the site database.</p>
<p>Though Melinda is a woman, on LUElinks she pretends (often implicitly) to be a man. This is a mechanism to protect herself from harassment, solicitations for pictures or “e-pussy,” unwanted attention through the creation of message board threads about her, and general denigration as an object with inferior intellect and worth. Melinda’s intentions are both to be free of harassment and to hold a reasonable amount of credibility through other posters’ respect–something she believes she would lose if she were to identify as female. Interestingly, Melinda claims not to be the only woman who is incognito. To this effect, she references the results of a site poll as well as a confirming message on a thread she started on the “anonymous” message board asking whether there are other women who pretend to be men on LUElinks.</p>
<p>LUElinks is a portmanteau of the acronym LUE, which stands for “Life, the Universe, and Everything,” and the word “links,” referring to the links to media content for which the site exists. The expansion of LUE is a phrase popularized by Douglas Adams’ comic radio show cum book cummovie, The Hitchhiker*fs Guide to the Galaxy. According to Melinda, and long before her time, LUElinks originated from a “Life, the Universe, and Everything” themed message board on the GameFAQs website forum. According to LUElink mythology, this corner of the forum received much attention from moderators due to conduct that violated the terms of service agreement, including supposedly lewd posting and, of course, alleged piracy. At some point, this discussion reached a critical mass at which a user, known by the handle Llamaguy, broke off from GameFAQs and created an independent message board that was private to only original LUE users and whose purpose was to support freely the file-sharing that took place on the board. Thus LUElinks was born.</p>
<p>Later, during Melinda’s tenure on LUElinks, the community began to express concern about the US government enforcing copyright by cracking down on media sharing sites similar to LUElinks. It is unclear what motivated the final decision, but eventually Llamaguy decided to migrate the site to a new domain. The site was moved to <a href="http://endoftheinter.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">endoftheinter.net</a>, where it currently remains. However, members of the site still refer to themselves and each other as LUElinkers. Additionally, LUElinkers actually meet in the physical world. Melinda reports meet-ups are usually organized to play games on a local area network. She does not attend partly due to lack of interest and partly because she does not want to reveal her identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case-Study #2 - William</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years ago, William attended a University summer program created to introduce high school students to college-level work in computer science and mathematics. He met a student there who gave him a different introduction–an introduction to piracy. Within days William had filled his 60 gigabyte hard drive to the brim with all sorts of media, and in the moment he was unable to download further, he realized something. He needed more space. In High School, a classmate introduced William to Japanese animation, or anime. His interest in pirating anime (as well as other media) blossomed as he entered college. In the school dormitories, William became a sizable file-sharing node on their internal network. He hosted and permitted the duplication of content through a peer-to-peer software called DC++, their version of which was tweaked by students in William’s dorm.</p>
<p>Since he no longer lives in the dorms, William largely pirates through other means. He is a member of a campus anime club that has regular meetings, hosts events such as an annual anime conference, and holds weekly screenings. There are physical exchanges of anime through USB drives, as well as independent piracy through other avenues. Among those other avenues, William uses BakaBT, a torrent tracking site that provides access to an array of torrents of complete anime series, listed after meeting quality requirements. Access to BakaBT is not restricted to registered users, however, registration is open to the public and carries perks like better search and the ability to upload. Another torrent site William uses for general downloading purposes is Demonoid, a popular, public, “everything and the kitchen sink” type of tracker. Many anime series that are not licensed in the United States, and thus do not have any supported distribution method, are only available through piracy. Sometimes these series are dubbed over in other languages, such as English, but most often they are sub-titled by fans, aptly named “fansubs.”</p>
<p>William is a computer gamer, and in some circumstances he pirates games he likes to play regularly or simply wants to try. He also pirates music, but since they are oldies from the 70s and 80s, he believes his piracy is justified because those songs’ copyright should have expired. William argues copyright law is supposed to support creativity, so making profit from old songs, to him, is unreasonable. On the other hand, William only pirates software that he believes to be unreasonably priced based on his expected use and what he considers a fair charge. William will pay for Windows 7 at the student price of $40, but refuses to pay even the student price of the Adobe Creative Suite since the amount he will use the software is very minimal–only every once in a while–and not for commercial purposes. As a computer scientist, he intends to practice his software price ideals in his future work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of Melinda, piracy is largely a backdrop, an implicit assumption of a practicing community of content consumers. LUElinks is a place she goes for stand-alone entertainment and socializing as much as it is a reliable place to locate media she desires. As for William, the type of content is a clear, major factor as to how he performs piracy and why. For example, William’s anime piracy takes place between several different groups, including physical and virtual interactions–and in the case of a demonoid torrent, there is no human-to-human interaction at all other than the tacit transfer of the content itself. The value of these case studies lies in, the particularities and minutia of their cultures and behaviors, on which the following results will focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Douglas Adams seemed to be the first port-of-call for a possible fandom subculture. We asked Melinda if people talk about Douglass Adams on LUElinks, to which she clarified, “I imagine on the original board they did, but no. It’s gone, […] it is its own entity […] it doesn’t really bring up images of Hitchhicker’s Guide anymore.” And fair enough, perhaps one can read too much into a namesake. What then, were some of Melinda’s favored creators? Louis Theroux was the only name shortlisted in her mind, so we prodded on what discussions there were about Theroux on LUElinks? “There was a topic recently that just listed all of his stuff on Youtube so you can go watch it, […] people giving their thoughts, now let’s see how many pages this went to?” She clicks on her laptop, “Average, I mean, the big ones stay on the front board a lot longer.” Melinda did have something to say about the man behind the documentaries, but it was unenthusiastic and the other LUElinkers corroborated by their relative absence of opinion.</p>
<p>The front board is the section where the site’s hottest discussion occurs, and Melinda even once herself started a topic about a creator that “got stickied” there for a time–Michael Cera. Yet the purpose was decidedly not fan-like. There was an official online poll of where Michael Cera should tour in support of his new film, “I just happened to notice in one of these metropolitan areas there was an ITT Tech. So I thought it would be kind of cool to make Michael Cera go on a national tour of ITT Techs.” LUElinks mobilized to skew the vote, “and we were leading in Boston and SF Bay area until the last few days.” Sending this celebrity actor astray highlights the LUElink mentality towards the origins of the media: unimportant, and even laughable. The artists here are at best shrugged off, and at worst humiliated. These figures for Melinda are not deserving of any figure other than zero when the topic of compensation arises. “I’m too poor,” she says, and that mindset along with creator irrelevance means she need not think any further about indemnity. The relationship for this Piracy Culture towards creators varies between uninterested and satirical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the existence of Anime Club, William explains, “we’re a group of people because of our interest, not because of any prior planning, we sort of pirate the same things.” The scope of the pirated media for them is narrow and it’s only specific media that brings them together. William acts as a bridge between Anime Club and BakaBT “because I pirated anime a lot before I joined, I was an ideal candidate to continue pirating anime for them.” Creators play a crucial role in both of these Piracy Cultures; they are not substitutable. “It’s something that, that we would, that the rest of America would never see unless it was [fan]subtitled.” When asked which anime William enjoyed, the titles and creators were forthcoming. “Studios that come to mind are Kyoto animation, and also Studio Shaft, which is one of my favorites, just because they produce really random off-the-wall stuff. The thing with Shaft is that, anything Shaft produces is never going to get licensed in the United States, it’s too crazy. There’s no market for it. The problem is that when they do license stuff, its stuff that’s airable on TV, that’s mass-marketable, not niche stuff that I would like.” For William much of his anime piracy is about acquiring content made by Studio Shaft by way of fansubs. Anime pirates’ enjoyment is indebted in large part to the labor and work of these creators, and William, at least, is well aware of this relation.</p>
<p>The appreciation of this work and knowledge of the law is displayed through a sensitivity and discrimination in piracy. As a representative William clarifies they are “careful when picking the shows showing in Anime Club next season because, our policy is that we don’t show something if it gets licensed.” Pirating anime shows yet to be licensed in the U.S. is okay, but if the anime becomes licensed then it is strictly hands off, “because of our industry friends that sponsor us, we don’t want to step on their toes.” Anime Club is sponsored by some official distribution intermediaries who support their conventions and events. Cognizant of the formal process of copyright and licensing, the Anime Club stays within important self-imposed bounds because they recognize the mutual benefits of symbiosis with  distributors and producers. To illustrate the extent of respect of this process, fans will comply regardless of their own appreciation of a given work. William relates that some in Anime Club “that watch fansubs were unhappy [when some popular anime showings were cancelled] because [companies] have been so trigger-happy with their licensing.” However, the club agrees to cease showings nonetheless, when the shows are licensed.</p>
<p>On downloading from BakaBT we ignorantly asked why those on the tracker did not “vote with their dollars?” The responding bombast is telling: “There’s no way we can! We have no means. If I purchase, let’s say a boxset of the Japanese version, it’s useless to me. I don’t know enough Japanese for it to be useful to me, there’s no way to vote with our money.” Then he displays some affection “I know Studio Shaft for a fact went through some really hard times last season and I would have loved to provide them with some kind of monetary compensation. I feel helpless sometimes. I want to help these guys out, and there’s no way of doing it.” An understanding is evident that consumption must be a dialogue where consumers support the creator; else the creator may not be able to supply the consumer. This Piracy Culture may not have created any material profit in an institutional sense, but it has created a connection between creator and consumer, an empathy which is a perfect stage for potential capitalization. “I really wish there was some way I could show how much I like, I adore their material.” This is a feeling made possible through Piracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No direct correlation is clear between the act of piracy and the relation between creator and consumer. The case studies presented here are disparate stories of both apathy and great care from the consumer to the creator. Rejecting the hypothesis, the evidence suggests Piracy Cultures do not necessarily promote a common a desire or motivation to relate to their artists. But Piracy Cultures can offer a closer connection as a feature, such as in William’s case. In Melinda’s case the closeness, not to creator, but to other consumers is a major aspect of LUElinks. In the research Piracy Cultures produce not merely free content distribution services, but importantly imbued goods with significant additional value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LUElinks is a showcase of a mastery in a user-generated user experience. With only simple message board software, a thriving community shines as the main attraction. In a wondrous state, on the topic of the image-posting threads on LUElinks, Melinda told us, “I’ve gotten actually drawn in to just looking at them for hours at a time,  I don’t know… they’re just nice pictures to look at.” Her difficulty in explanation is around a hypnotic phenomenon, akin to that of the enigmatic and legendary imageboard, <a href="http://4chan.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">4chan.org</a>. The imageboards of photoshopped humour are a type of “sharing” themselves though more focused around discussion of topics than exchange of images, and serve more as a vessel for social networking. Like aPlayboy reader, but in earnest, she admits “honestly, it’s just interesting, I enjoy reading the topics. I mean look at my tabs (she points to a browser tab bar of closely nestled LUElinks icons), it’s all fucking LUElinks.” On other boards users answer questions, share fitness tips, discuss commonplace grievances, and give advice on life. The community at LUElinks is its killer feature. LUElinks is entertainment and a secure, vibrant community in Melinda’s life, infinitely more than a dumb pipe for media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BakaBT isn’t just a torrent tracker, it’s purveyor of luxury and hard-to-find items. They offer only entire seasons of anime, a collector’s pleasure, and crucially (for non-Japanese speakers) fansubbed anime. Carrying only complete collections of anime highlights the serious and dedicated nature of BakaBT ideology. Yet, the most killer feature for BakaBT is the access to fansubbed anime. BakaBT gives the users what they want, William relays that institutional distributors “don’t expect people to want subtitles they expect them to want dubs.” Anime lovers and researchers attest that fansubs have major upshots (Mäntylä 2010). The first and most obvious is shared with dubbing, that you can watch a Japanese-only anime even if you are an English-only consumer. The second is a trophy of commons-based peer production. Fans are collaboratively translating their favorite anime to make subtitles that are, as William opines, “in a lot of ways  better than professional subtitling. Fansbbers are actually superior because they actually care about what they’re translating.” But it’s not just William that holds fansubbing in high regard, in an ironic twist of fate, the U.S. distributors do too. William shared this anecdote with us:</p>
<p>just recently there was a show on TV called “Greatest Otaku” or something like that … basically they took a tour of Funimation studios where they do the dubbing, and they had a shot, the shot that eveyone’s talking about, a shot into the ‘dub’ room. They had an anime on screen that they were dubbing. The strange thing about the anime on screen that they were dubbing was, the subtitles. Looking at the anime it looks very normal, except the subtitles looked nice, you thought ‘the subtitles look nice, what’s going on here?’ […] It’s a fan sub […] they’ve been crusading against fansubbers, and they’re just hypocrites!</p>
<p>A favored scandal by the anime community, the debacle serves as evidence for the legitimacy and quality of fansubbing (“Downloaded … ” 2011). High speed downloads of almost professionally archived anime, with better than professional subtitling, of locally unavailble content are the killer features that bring William BakaBT. The price is free as well, but to hold that as the main feature would miss the point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Major and direct market indicators came from our research, evident in the piracy of games. The first and most powerful was a trope that both Melinda and William gave with verbatim duplicate phrasing: “Try before you buy.” The concept is self explanatory but meaningful. On LUElinks there is a practice: “it’s a pretty common sentiment that if you really really like something, you’ll pay money for it. You’ll even see people in the link page if they really liked it, they’ll come back and post ‘I’m buying this.’ […] but generally, the rule of thumb is you try it out first.” On LUElinks, buying is the greatest flattery for a game on your hard disk, “you already have it obviously, that’s how you show support for the [developer].” Post-play purchase was also a sentiment echoed by William who says he likes to, “follow the try before you buy mentality, I’ll pirate a game, try it out, and if I like it enough I’ll buy it from the company.” For whatever it is worth gamers seem to be united in this modus operandi, a signal the market could well heed.</p>
<p>A second related signal comes from seeing Piracy as a pricing problem in the same way as the Social Sciences Research Council does (2011). When a gamer sees a price as reasonable, sometimes try before you buy is too cumbersome. William chimes, “if it’s on Steam and it’s cheap, I won’t even pirate it in the first place. There are so many games in my steam library that I haven’t even played because they were only five dollars.” Steam is already a well heralded market solution but the admission coming from an active pirate is one not to be ignored. Although it may be the case that free cannot be beaten, the monetary price is not the only cost in acquiring a game; there are levers that the institutional markets could pull to draw more pirates to their services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Piracy Cultures allow their users to be the lever-operators and cog-designers of their own engines. In being their own engineers they have developedkiller features. A glimpse of this is evident in the research. From Melinda it is seen that any market solution offered to her must have strong social networking components among the consumer base: the country-club style community. From William it is seen that to be drawn to any market solution it must provide him access to the niche long tail content he desires (Anderson 2004). Also he wants assurance the distributors and subtitlers care as much about the content as himself. Some of the killer features here have clear conversion potential for creator compensation. William regrets that he is powerless to give his beloved content creators any innovation stipend. Realistically though, not all Piracy Culture’s killer features could be directly employed in the task of reimbursing the creators. Whether or not these features could be cashed in on indirectly is another question that will require creativity to answer in the positive. However, in all cases, the killer features do signal auxiliary desires fulfilled by their distribution mechanism. You need not be a behavioral economist to calculate difference in appeal between institutionalized markets and Piracy Cultures; when faced with the choice, no one says “give me the more expensive, less convenient, less valuable one.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The research shows some Piracy Cultures have evolved to provide built-in supplementary and value-addition services to suit their users’ desires. Institutional Markets may view these services as necessary additions in order to compete. Of course when viewing killer features as market demands, they aren’t accompanied with a clear solution on compensating creators; there is not much negotiation forthcoming on that front from pirates. In order to know whether the future holds these Piracy Cultures as perpetual counter-cultures or not will be reliant on whether institutions shift to accommodate the above-outlined consumer demands, or effectively declare an impasse. Therefore until either one is solved, a conundrum is problematized: is society more content with the unsettled issue of creator compensation or unmet consumer demands?</p>

        <p>Perusing the Jerusalem last night, unwittingly in my Wikipedia sweatshit, I was asked about my donation this year. On the tail of my positive response I richoceted the question. “Yes,” he responded “you had the picture of the cute girl [on the banner].”</p>
<p>Internal measurements of banner ad effectiveness are well examined in the Wikimedia foundation. If it’s found that pictures of attractive young female editors sell donations faster, should that be exploited. Or is sexism for a good cause, still sexism?</p>

        <p>There’s a problem on Wikipedia, one that I am, as a male, not entirely qualified to answer, but has nonetheless incessantly perturbed me. Women have been <a href="http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">statistically shown</a> to edit Wikipedia far less than their population proportion would suggest. As noted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Faith_Collaboration" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Good Faith Collaboration</em></a> by Joseph Reagle, an encyclopedia reflects it’s authorship. Naturally the question arises, what can be done about the gender gap? I contend there is a glimmer of hope in finding a solution and the first ray shone on my face from the LCD when facebook news fed me this picture.</p>
<p><a href="http://notconfusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wiki-facebook-post.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://notconfusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wiki-facebook-post.png?w=300" alt="" title="Wiki Facebook Post"></a></p>
<p>Katie, a student of the <a href="http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Education_Program" target="_blank" rel="external">Wikipedia Education Program</a> in her proud post showed that something was happening correctly. That there was something cool, so edgy in fact that it was facebook-worthy, about editing, and that the appeal wasn’t male-only. In Wikipedia terms the fight against skewed writer demographics is known as “Countering Systemic Bias,” and the Wikipedia Education Program is doing just that. The logic goes that university students, the target of the Education Program, are evenly divided or woman-heavy in terms of gender, and so having them edit as an assignment would start steering averages. Now more affirmation is being received for that hypothesis, but also important details are arising in how exactly the bias manifests itself.</p>
<p>Zachary McDowell’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:United_States_Education_Program/Courses/Writing_as_Communication_(Zachary_McDowell" target="_blank" rel="external">Writing as Communication</a>) course, a participant in the Education Program under my ambassadorship of the New England Wikipedia Brains In Education (NEWBIE) region, came second on the <a href="http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Education_Program/Fall_2011/Leaderboard_US" target="_blank" rel="external">leaderboard</a> of text added amongst all classes. Upon investigating the work conducted in the course my eyes pricked up at some of the topics chosen. They were gender conscious and underrepresented. Zachary McDowell  related to me that his students, of which 75% are female, were relishing the assignment, and that having been given the option of choosing whatever article they wanted to edit they were selecting poignant and telling subjects about gender. Immediately I tracked down some of the top female editors and interviewed them.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Daniellecomm375" title="User:Daniellecomm375" target="_blank" rel="external">Daniellecomm375</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Eff_Gjeni" title="User:Eff Gjeni" target="_blank" rel="external">Eff Gjeni</a>, main contributors to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality_in_music_videos" target="_blank" rel="external">Sexuality in Music Videos</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_advertisement" target="_blank" rel="external">Gender Advertisement</a> respectively are two top performing students of the course, and had meaningfully nonchalant answers to my questioning them. Neither of them was aware of an existing gender gap in the encyclopedia they’d been editing when we talked. Neither of them thought that they were writing about topics that were explicitly feminine, they rightly pointed out were human topics. Still, their choice of topics uncovered less explored areas in the encyclopedia, and their experience highlighted some potential male bias in Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>In answering the question of why she chose her topic Daniellecomm375 pleaded <em>write what you know. </em>“My friends and I are always talking about things like ‘can you believe how skinny that actress is?’” she offhands in seriousness that is not distant from the gossipy nature she is describing. The presence of ideas like thinness paranoia, a common conversation for Daniellecomm375 and her friends, were skeletal at best on Wikipedia. She continues, “I wanted to make the article relatable.” And certainly to a specific demographic Sexuality in Music Videos is. Discussions of body image, the prevalence of anorexia, and misogyny are treated, and it’s hard to imagine being as committed to the dispersal of the research around it if you can’t relate to the symptoms. Daniellecomm375 was filling a vacuum she noticed.</p>
<p>Eff Gjeni likewise was not successful in finding issues close to her daily life. “I wanted to write about fashion first, but there weren’t many articles on it,” she laments, as an indication of existing bias. Having settled on Gender Advertising, she still disputes that the discipline is an innately female subject, “We think that it’s a problem that images in advertising show that women are supposed to be a certain way, but I wanted to talk about men in the article, it’s hard for men too.” Here she enforced that she wasn’t writing with a feminist slant, and her article indeed voices an equal, and clinical tone. It’s well put that the topics are about genders, none in specific. Still, a topic as large as Gender Advertising remaining immature into 2011 is reflective of the notion that it takes a multiplicity of authors and author backgrounds to write on the sum total of human knowledge.</p>
<p>An anecdote that Daniellecomm375 deconstructs for me seems to suggest that perhaps the answer has some historical moorings. “The first day of class, when I heard that we were going to edit Wikipedia articles, I can remember looking around the class and thinking [of the 25% men] the boys are going to do much better than I am.” Daniellecomm375 ranked second in the individual category of the leaderboard, so while reality being exactly opposite, where is the psychology stemming from I inquired? “I think it’s in the academic tradition, as a women you don’t feel like you’ll be taken seriously in university, so if someone knows you’re a woman on Wikipedia you think they’re also not going to take you seriously.” With an upright posture and a grim message Daniellecom375 is a statue of a regrettable matter of fact. The gender role of timidity again rises when Danielle recounts the emotional pain of an edit war she was involved in. “I asked him [presuming the warring editor is a ‘him’] do you not want me to edit your article? Because if you don’t, I won’t.” To Danielle any cracked eggs are failure, not the making of an omelette. Some official principles, such as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Be Bold</strong></a> in editing Wikipedia,” Danielle seems to suggest are not readily part of a behavior with which she associates. It lays the underpinnings for more clashing, something that is not part of her socialization.</p>
<p>When I brought up the subject of hurt feelings with Eff Gjeni a diversity of opinion is shown. I ask her about the prevailing theory - extolled even by Jimmy Wales himself at the latest Wikimania - that the increase of negative bot-left warnings on user pages has brought about a harsher climate for editors. The corollary of the theory being that women, who are more consensus based decision makers, like less the impersonalized tone and algorithmic arrival of warning text. “I don’t find the messages discouraging at all,” she twists “it makes me want to correct the mistakes.” So with that golden key to the mystery evaporating I ask Eff Gjeni what she thinks can be done? She lingers wordlessly in thought for a few moments and responds “I think that if the gender gap was advertised more, it would make women want to edit more.” The internet’s less frequently clicked destinations have been typically the haunts of a distinct clique. Simply allowing something to be moused, won’t mean it will be in equal measures by all sexes, Eff Gjeni surmises.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia Education Program is finding editors who were oblivious to the gender gap, and starting to mend it. Systemic bias is being countered with the likes of Daniellecomm375 and Eff Gjeni’s contributions because they have found an outlet to which they weren’t previously privy. Moreover, it is nourishing their transition from newbies to fluent editors, through it’s structure and campus ambassador support system. On whether they would continue to edit now that courses have finished, both gave a resounding “definitely.” There are subtle hints also that some long-ago agreed tenets - like Be Bold - might be borne under biased times, and to gather worthwhile feedback we will need the voices of those less represented. With the new Wikipedia reader <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Editors_Survey_November_2011#How_can_I_take_the_survey.3F" target="_blank" rel="external">survey</a> statistics being collected at the moment, one question of which is “Gender:” we will be able to see if there is any trend in the gender gap. The Wikipedia Education Program may be of insignificant magnitude at the moment to move the needle, but it is a growing laboratory that is discovering potent remedies.</p>

        <p>“No - your refrigerator is too low-fidelity to be counted as a phonograph: it cannot reproduce sounds at all.” (Hofstadter 406). This retort in Goedel Escher Bach from Achilles to the Tortoise represents the crux of the argument between Zen and the Pragmatist. While Achilles reacts sensibly to the inaudability of the cold plastic disk, isn’t the Tortoise in competition for Zen practitioner of the year?</p>
<p>In my most recent involvement with self-appointed subculture, the Zorba Festival, the nerve centre of all Negev Desert chill-outs, I lost a similar battle but wouldn’t know it until too late. The tent was in fact patchwork canvas over a geodesic dome, the time late, and the attendees personified bric-a-brac. After a half hour wispy and softly spoken crash course on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koan" title="Koan" target="_blank" rel="external">Koan</a>s we were instructed to sit in partnered lines and ask the Koan-du-jour to each other. The style is must be explained is that for one hour in alternating 10 minute segments the answerer will ponder the Koan to their counterpart whose only job is to listen and stare into the orator’s eyes. Skeptical, but still curious, and being in the initial position I spoke to the Koan “Who is in?” I started a dialectical journey on the distinction of in/out, and what or who was even qualified to be split into these categories. When the clava rang-out the indication to switch roles, I could not have prepared myself for what was to come. Following her silent and tranquil cross-legged listening of  my philosophy this Woman erupted with a voice-wrenching tirade scapegoating me for her eating-disorder. “Will you love me if I have half-and-half  in my Coffee?! Will you love me if I have linguine with the sour-cream?! The 30% sour-cream?! Will you LOVE me THEN?!” The outburst flourished into an inspection of all the personal details surrounding this difficulty, and posited that I may not love her if she didn’t jog at the gym daily or indulged in various confections. Round two commenced, and wiping some spittle that was projected onto my cheeks from her raging mouth, I continued my calm discourse on what “in” meant for society or for one’s personal life. On her second round of answering she leaned into my tensely unblinking eyes and shouted about the saga of her hips loud enough that the Zen master came to restrain the obviously very disgruntled, and probably very hungry woman.</p>
<p>It may seem that I followed the Zen path more closely in this encounter, but that I see now is the view of the Zen amateur. This woman was using her refrigerator as a record player (she would have mentioned that would be ample room). “Will you love me then?!” was really was an inquiry like, “Do you hear this record in this fridge?” I thought I had to ignore her to make my point clear that fridges don’t play records. But that only meant I never got to understand the sound of a fugue on a Frigidaire.</p>

        <p>On the last page of Jaron Lanier’s <em>You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto</em>,typically where you expect some encompassing conclusion, you will receive the baffling premonition of, “I imagine a virtual saxophone-like instrument in virtual reality with which I can improvise both golden tarantulas and a bucket with all the red things. If I knew how to build it now, I would, but I don’t.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which if you have read all the pages as well as the last one, in true order, you will find to be fitting conclusion. For the <em>manifesto</em> is much more a poorly meshed attempt to collect his small findings, gigs, opinions and brainstorms since his day prototyping Virtual Reality in the 80s. As if it were a magic mortar Lanier attempts to congeal and tie his non-sequential thoughts together with large claims in technology’s meaning for humanity. Yet owing to it’s anecdotal format what is produced can sometimes seem just a griping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance it is claimed that, unlike the 60’s, music today has no definitive style. To prove this he’s supposedly made bets with adolescents that he’s come across, played them a song and then asked them if the song was from 1998 or 2008. Jaron reports that they weren’t able to tell the difference. The quality of this study is not particular solid. Remaining consistent with his unfounded speculation and exaggerated extrapolation are other claims about how contemporary User Interface design robs us of our humanity. This is evident in the supposed fact that Facebook’s relationship status multiple choice decision is making us more binary, computational, and less human. I chose not to “like” this claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fairhandedly though, while swinging his arms madly, every so often Lanier lands a punch. On the topic of Music Piracy he admits that as much as we might want to tell the Recording Associations and their labels that they should have adapted to new technologies long ago and are now paying the price in their downfall, there is scarce constructive criticism at how they might do that. This is a valid proposition because it is unreasonable to expect change without knowing what the change is you really want. It is not that requesting the Record Industry to adapt is burdensome, but that without giving them some direction they really are the victims they make themselves out to be. Victimisation does not excuse any scare tactics they might use or past extortion they may have committed, but we ought to be at least slightly more sympathetic to their problem if we can’t propose better solutions than they are implementing. Therefore we should be frantically brainstorming suggests Lanier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us join him for a moment. We don our VR goggles and boldly slip on our datagloves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take as a working assumption that in the future we would still like recompense as an incentive for creating music. This means there is a nearly untenable need to monetise a nearly free commodity. Owing to that difficulty only the most outlandish and novel innovations ever rear their heads from consumer-thinkers. We’ve seen <em>flattr</em> which has it’s advantage in ease, but still relies on altruism. There was a poster in Berkeley’s iSchool (can anyone identify this author) proposing that buying songs should also give you fractional—albeit marginally diminishing—profits in the subsequent purchases of the same song. Therefore you would have an incentive to buy as you could eventually recoup most of your money if more people bought the song. Certainly this is a novelty but it may taste too much like a ponzi scheme for many.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the world of torrents the economics of ratios and seedboxes I once offered could become a profitable market following an analogy to that of solar energy. The seedbox bandwidth would be rented out to you for a fixed monthly price, and the higher your ratio at the end of the month the more you’d earn back. This would be scaled in such a way that the most advanced users could potentially even yield cash from the grid, but the average user would pay in. The desire to spend on music relies again on the profit incentive, and also on the fact that some community organised torrent trackers often surpass commercial libraries in selection and quality because of long-tail effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lanier provides a third imagining of charging for music in the future: <em>songles</em>. Songles are fashionably packaged RFID dongles which play music on a remote stereo. That is you wear a digitally connected bracelet (or it could be on your keychain) which would beam the song(s) contained within to a nearby hi-fi. The idea might succeed for more reasons than what he touches in his manifesto. The idea might succeed because there is a desire to share our songs with our friends. The concept has been proved since Lanier published in 2010 with turntable.fm . The magic of turntable.fm is that everyone in a room vies to become 1 of 5 DJs who then rotate between playing songs of their choosing. Basically this allows braggadocio of taste, which is a powerful sociological force. Turntable.fm right now works through the browser, which is not very convenient as you want to physically rather than digitally bob your head. The key companion hardware for a songle answers this physicality, it is the auto-DJ console that shuffles through the songs contained within partygoers wrists, necks, and pockets. The party DJing is directly crowdsourced which makes an appealing dynamic. Similarly the same would work at a coffeeshop or pub who’s public music could be selected passively from the patrons. The argument that such corporate institutions would be averse to relinquishing the power over their carefully designed atmosphere could be trumped by their own profit motives. That is, if the music that is played in a shop to induce you to buy is less effective at increasing sales than allowing people to listen to their own music, then businessmen may be on board. Music opinions are a neverending conversation amongst many today, something that could be valuably capitalised upon to save the moribund paradigm of paid music creation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The songles have their main revenue source in the fact that they are physical and therefore you must buy them, says Lanier. Not exactly so, I see Geeky students on ebay buying RFID read/writers making a business out of slipping cheap chips from China to their friends. Additionally from the same crowd I foresee a new tsunami of Rickrolling at Starbucks. The songle ecosystem is not hacker-proof, but it for success it only need to be more hacker-resillent than CD-ripping. Therefore a glimmer of hope may yet exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of whether songles will triumph or not, the idea is at least emblematic of the sort of thinking that frees consumers from their current hypocrisy towards the old institutions. Importantly it is born of the same creativity that dreams psychedelic spider-conjuring eSaxophones. The lesson that can be learned here is that we must imagine what it is that we would pay for in music to allow a chance for paid music creation to survive. I imagine a virtual lounge-like club in virtual reality in which I can mingle with other listeners of the same song, and inspect artefacts related to the artist and genre. If I knew how to build it now, I would, but I don’t.</p>
