        <p>While Ceephax has exposed me to a hyperactive, ultrajoyful side of myself, Why? has shown me how to cope with inexorable loss of impermanent identities. Just today I was going to go to an event I’d been looking forward to for over a year; the Stupor Bowl is a 50 mile bike ride in Minneapolis, stopping at 9 bars, and on the coldest day of the year. But after ceding a pool table yesterday to a man who my friends told me looked very much like myself, due to his moustache and cycling jacket, I became paralyzed by the self-awareness of my new identity. Without realising it I was becoming not just a person who rode their bicycle in the winter, but ‘a winter cyclist’. A winter cyclist is a person who takes pride in wrestling their bike in a blizzard when all their friends tell them it’s too dangerous to ride. There are elements of environmentalism and human vs. nature, but there are greater proportions of fashion, and bro-subculture.</p>
<p>Seeing the new label I’d taken made me ponder, having moved to North-Midwest-Central-North-America, what has become of the identies I used to hold. I had a lot invested in being: a vegan, a (motor)cyclist, a nudist and burner, a yogi, a feminist, an open source proponent, and being self-employed. None of them have disappeared but they have all become subdued and muted. It’s too hard not sharing these identities with my close community in academia. That is a shame. I want to make my life so that it can be easier to uphold those principles, and - very importantly - discover new turn ons. But this isn’t about thet future right now. It’s about finding yourself surprised to have changed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pull up to critical mass in a gas guzzling ford.”<br>Why?  of course came before and warned me about this moment. Although it’s not the stupor bowl but critical mass the reference is still perfect. I recall the first time I heard this lyric in 2012 when “Sod in the Seed” had come out. I was in my living room in Oakland in the height of my critical-massing-going life. Earlier that week I’d had narrowly escaped arrest for a having just feathered over the line of the patience of a cop at the protest. The feeling of invicibility and rebelious youth was fresh. That I was still residually high from the demonstration, and that my rap idol had been there and now was somehow “over” it was a great cognitive disonnance. Now it makes sense, I was forewarned that the atrophy of my dogma in political cycling is natural. Confess your inner feelings with special emphasis on your paradoxes and you’ll be free Yoni Wolf had instructed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Why? lyric realisation is merely the lesson-du-jour from the band’s discography. I recall so many of the first times I’ve understood a meaning from the backpack rapper that it’s becoming burdensome. Here’s the lucky part, my obsession with Nicholshon Baker lead me to an experimental treatment outlined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_and_I:_A_True_Story" target="_blank" rel="external">U and I</a>, a story of his fascination with John Updike. I will now administer. The process calls for a complete ban on media consumption from the subject, then walk through the valley of the shadow of ego death, and find out how the fantasy of being Yoni Wolf has changed me.</p>
<p>I’ve restrained myself from listenening to any Why? since March 2014, and am ready to begin.</p>

        <h2 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h2><p>In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQfFuMIQKY0" target="_blank" rel="external">_Ceephax Acid Crew _Live youtube video</a> there’s a comment which says “Love that one guy going nuts.” And it’s true, there is a guy in the front of the crowd feeling the music and letting his body follow. That’s not a particularly amazing fact to many people, but to me its a revelation on a virality with which I’m infected. Because just 24 hours earlier, I was that person in the front.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQfFuMIQKY0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>24 hours even before I was going nuts, I was getting nervous. Ceephax was playing at the Science Museum in San Francisco, and this would be my first opportunity to see him in the flesh. In that way that turns off your sense of decorum, I wanted to show him just what his music meant to me. My plan was to utilize some Nardwuar-esque deep fan knowlege. What only an unashamed geek would know is that Ceephax is, in addition to his music, a connoisseur of funky-design jumpers and carpets. He used to keep an gallery (that is sadly not online anymore) of the zig-zag neons, sharp-angled bright purples, and multi-coloured galaxy-exploding textiles that pepper our world. The morning before the concert I took time off work to go to the local charity shop to find an outrageous torso-warmer to give as a present.</p>
<p>Armed with the most outlandish garment I could scour, I shot to the museum, striding quickly and with purpose. I went alone and being by myself added an anxiety to the mission, I had no social cover, I had to admit my compulsion. I felt the omen in the air and walked my path of mystic discovery. The first rung in the gauntlet was that I had to find Ceephax among the exhibition halls. I asked myself, if I were Ceephax where would I be? Years of surfing forums had prepared me, and quickly found him by the audio hacking station. Here things got harder. Having spotted him from behind, I waited a moment, trying to calculate my next move. Tap on the shoulder? Insert myself into the conversation? What would I say? How much small talk?</p>
<p>Even though I’m not a shy person, I decided to wait near-by without giving any signals that I wanted chat, uncharacteristically my reverence was guiding me to be polite. That was gravity of the situation. But patience paid off, he got a bit bored and look around - then I pounced, “Hi Andy, I’m Max Klein [hand out for shake].” “Hi” he replied accepting my hand. The next seconds of silence pressed on me as I found my words. “I like your music, and I know you like strange jumpers a lot, so I have a present for you.” I handed over the jumper which he tried on immediately. It fit, and he thanked me. Having run out of activity, self-consciousness became crippling, so I slipped away unceremoniously. Later, in a trying-not-to-care, waiting-for-the-show-phase, I saw someone else give him a jumper and he didn’t try it on. I took this as the compliment I wanted.</p>
<p>Ceephax was the only act that night. This wasn’t a music hall, there was no stage, and the open space was proportioned poorly for a concert. As he played, I danced. The crowd was nerd-full, and they spread themselves out to stand back and nod their heads with ample comfort bubbles. I felt like they were insulting Ceephax, and his 4x4 beats which are meant for moving, and not caring how you do it. I charged front and center, closed my eyes, and started to loosen my hips, my neck, and arms.</p>
<p>I turned to face the crowd rather than Ceephax, it was too much to look at him while he played. The same phenomena occurs when you ask someone a complex question, they can’t look at your face, it’s too much information to process human expressions and multiplying digits at the same time. Anyway, I wanted to show my appreciation and that meant no cognition allowed, just embodied pumping, swinging and channelling of the relentless bass. After a track of being alone in a semi-circle radius around the stage, one more super fan joined. I acknowledged them with a micro-nod worked into the jerky dance, and went back to closing my eyes. On the second track, two more joined us, and on the third track another four, etc. until the crowd shifted and agglomerated. The sweat started to flow and the Acid House came alive.</p>
<p>What is Acid House? It’s an infection. When you get into an Acid House state, it’s about riding the wave between human funk and algorithmic machines, and the way that pushes your body’s limits. The music gets faster and harder until you think it can’t get any faster or harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0eMgrPPgOk?t=36s" target="_blank" rel="external">“We’re going to go faster and faster, until you fucking explode.” </a>warns Ceephax . When Ceephax pushes beyond to the volcanic point, the music surpasses mental comprehension, it breaks a sort of barrier, and that’s the key freeing moment. At that moment, you can’t step to the beat, you have to accept the rules are broken. This is jarring because just moments before you were in a dream listening to very predictable lullaby melodies. If you’re suddenly uncomfortable without the tropes of ancient greek aestheticism this will be frustrating. If you understand the game, you revel in the lawlessness of this temporary zone where the only context is pure chaos and it doesn’t matter at all what your limbs do next, so you may as well try and do something very odd with them.</p>
<p>That night I reached acid-house-nirvana several times. I binged on Ceephax, and my body was flushed off the pent up tension of acting acceptably in polite society. Being spent, I was ready to restore normality. Which was why at the end, when the DJ in the admiral hat told me that he was playing an unannounced underground rave the next night in my stomping grounds of Oakland, I felt like I couldn’t step through that next portal. But I knew I had to go, even though I had completely expended myself as if it all ended tonight.</p>
<p>So a day later, I found myself bicycling to “Babeland” in Chinatown, an unsuspecting apartment-cum-venue for a night, in an unassuming part of Oakland. This was exactly the sort of place I wanted to see Ceephax, it was as grungy and unpretentious as possible. Upstairs there was an art installation with a playable NES whose visuals were distorted by filters, and the bar was serving rainbow-flavoured ice-cream for $1 per scoop. Underneath was the “stage” which was a folding table in garage located at the end of a squeeze-through hall way. Fire standards would mandate no more than 20 people in the room. Maximum bus-in-the-rain capacity was probably 40 people shoulder-to-shoulder. There were probably 50 humans, and the 8 foot ceiling made is seem like even more. Once again I worked my way to the front to get in position for adulation.</p>
<p>Any beginning Ceephaxer knows that part of his magic is that he doesn’t use computers to generate sound, only dedicated music equipment like synthesizers. I turned to the person next to me in painted-on white jeans and tie-dye and tried to engage the subject. “Sometimes I like to listen to just drum machine and synths,” I tried to impress. “Sometimes I like to just listen to drum machine” he retorted. It was a clever one-up, and right then I knew I was in the right place. What transpired that night was an ego-melting sacred ritual.</p>
<p>Here I didn’t need to prove to the crowd that they should get close and dance their brains stupid. From the start there were only two classes of standing room: whether you could tell when Ceephax last showered, or whether you could discern the spice mix of his last meal. That was accompanied by the flipped script of the standard U.S. not talking to strangers. Somebody recognized me from the night before, put his arm around me and said with his eyes “Welcome. You didn’t know you were one of us did you? It’s OK, its hard to admit at first, but you’re among friends now”. So we went on adventure together, it was called Ceephax going absolutely HAM. The experience encompassed me completely, the physical arrangement, the feeling of familial safety, the deafening trance. Best of all I didn’t need to feel shame for liking it. The more we gyrated and spasmed, the more life outside went from inconsequential to not existing at all.</p>
<p>The wave started to swell. The cadence quickened and the tracks became more layered and punchy. We coming up to the acid edge. But just about when the hyperdrive was about to engage an unexpected twist came. Ceephax fumbled a button, and the machines started firing all at once. It was mayhem, and fate beyond any of our freewill. You could see Ceephax exasperated, not being able to turn them off. It didn’t sound “good”, unsync’d beats were colliding akwardly. Yet at the same time it was amazing. We were already too high on snare-rushes and melodies that going from “A to B to X” was just more scenery on our milky way journey.</p>
<p>It was all over when there were no more encores left to give. In the absence the dominating feeling was a palpable camaraderie. We were tied together by ringing in ears and shirts that we were struggling to get off because they were soaked through. Our physical condition left us in no state to even communicate, we could only muster “very good” in reply to “good” when we saw each other with wide smiles. After half an hour basking in the good vibes around smoking circles outside I slumped my way to my bicycle. On the ride home as my brain started to reverted to normalcy I began to wonder about this hyperstimulation, and what my susceptibility to it meant. I wondered if I had undiagnosed epilepsy? I called my Mum the next day to see she had ever thought I shown signs of autism.</p>
<p>I still listen to Ceephax a lot, but beyond these concerts I can recount only 2 memorable instances of Ceephax. Once at rave in the woods in north of Berlin, where a few people got into it until some men who were very serious about their brand of house told me to turn it off. The other was at Burning Man when even my lax campmates actually preferred to go to bed than take it any longer.</p>
<p>Ceephax Acid Crew is #2 on my list of music and associated transcendental experiences. Why? is the first by an order of magnitude.</p>

        <p>I didn’t like the Dyson Airblade at first. Its slick futuristic form with neon yellow striping gives the visual indication that it will <em>instantly</em> dry your hands, which it doesn’t. It takes 12 seconds. Still, I claim this represents a revolution. The watch-a-microwave-tick-down waiting time is a small price to pay for leaving the tiled room with hands truly free of water, rather than the <em>less-wet</em> state my whole life prior to this invention taught me was normal.</p>
<p>[caption id=”” align=”alignright” width=”270”]<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Dyson_Airblade_Transparent_BG.png/512px-Dyson_Airblade_Transparent_BG.png" alt=""> The Dyson Airblade. Attribution: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dyson_Airblade_Transparent_BG.png[/caption" target="_blank" rel="external">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dyson_Airblade_Transparent_BG.png[/caption</a>]</p>
<p>To understand why the Airblade represents such a leap forward in hand-drying technology, we have to understand the past that Dyson was trying to escape. My earliest adventures in cognizant demoisturising were at my primary school, as a beanling that still hadn’t mastered the use of a fly. At that time the state of the art was the rotating towel. This was a wall-mounted box from which hung a loop of cloth towel. You would use the towel loop as normal, and when it became too wet to be effective at all, you could pull on, and advance the towel to an unused portion.</p>
<p>This is when I first came to suspect “drying your hands” was a bit of a misnomer. The towels in use with this looper were of such low quality that they bordered on plastic. This meant that absorption was low, and the inflexibility of the material could not easily journey through the intra-finger crevices. Thus, being commanded to dry my hands by my teachers was a tough lesson in delivering an impossibility.</p>
<p>But because we were living in those dark-(read: wet)-ages, we couldn’t perceive the problem, let alone the solution. I suppose the impetus to move off the technology was spurred by germophobic objections. Perhaps I am only using the term <em>germophobes</em> because I did grow up as a hardened looped-rag wiper. For in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#Efforts_to_reduce_childbed_fever" target="_blank" rel="external">Ignaz Semmelweis</a> vein of antiseptic precaution - who reduced mortality rates for delivering mothers from 18% to 2% - we had yet to see the linkage between disease and this a bacteria conveyor belt. Yet, in retrospect I have have nostalgic pining for this conglomeration of metal and linen, for its speed and environmental sustainability, two measures it scores well on.</p>
<p>The Ouroboric fabric was much better than it’s successor - hot blown air. HBA fails miserably because of the temporal consideration. Only when I have wanted to see if, given enough time would the technique eventually desiccate my hand, have I not given up the loud nuisance. Throughout my adolescent years, my hygiene routine in restaurants, petrol and train stations, consisted of washing, and then slapping those large buttons with my elbow. This activated a machine that drew electricity from the grid and deafened me, but didn’t dry for shit. I left a trail of drips on my way to the door as I wiped my hands on my trousers.</p>
<p>Testament to its failure, blown air is disappearing from the consumer landscape. A few last ditch efforts have been made to modernize the heated jet streams with the bolting-on of proximity sensors, but I think public can tell that this is just flash without substance. Hot air is just that.</p>
<p>Of course, a third option has tried to merge the relative usefulness of elliptic towels, with a de-communalized nature: paper towels. Paper towels work, there is no doubt, but their down fall is the degree of ignorance with which they force you live. I worked in a dot-com office park on a bland 5th floor, whose corporate toilets’ only pizazz were the luxurious 2-ply paper towels. The waste generated by paper towels is enormous mostly because of unused proportion of towel. If you look in a bin where paper towels are tossed off you will see that for any given towel less than 50% of it is actually damp.</p>
<p>During my time at that office I attempted to cultivate a technique which would maximize per-sheet usage. With enough care I found that 1 can be sufficient, there is a lot of fibre at your disposal that simply takes patience to utilize. While this might seem partly a way forward, the real issues here are cultural and educational. I received the same level of frustration that I might with someone sitting on a public transport blocking an open seat, when I would I stand at the mirror carefully detailing my hands and some ignorant fellow would waltz in and take 3 massive, unconscious pulls at the pulped-goods.</p>
<p>The marketers of paper towel, trying to childishly to save themselves from obsolescence have thrown in the red-herring of compostability. Naturally this just incentivizes waste all the more. The cleverest approach I’ve noticed to mitigating the ketchup-packets at McD’s mindset was a sticker on a paper towel dispenser in hippie-haven Shasta, California. It said “These come from trees. This sticker saves 1,000 towels per year.” The appeal to fulfil this prophecy was strong, and I hope many take up the cause.  Still we have only a small bandage on our aquatic crisis.</p>
<p>Lateral thinking approaches to navigate around the drying dilemma involve not getting wet in the first place. Another wasteful, non-renewable way, is the anti-bacterial gel method. We encounter this in the Western world when running water is not available, and for me personally is highly associated with Burning Man. I don’t dislike this technique because you do save on water and drying. But we have been warned about the future danger of antibiotic-resistant super germs if our hubris in this technique grows too large. I can’t live with that kind of responsibility on my hands.</p>
<p>Alcogel’s no-dry logic can be twisted even further. A friend of mine Sergey once tweeted that he felt guilty <em>for</em> washing his hands, if he didn’t dirty them while in the bathroom. That makes sense, perhaps the most environmental way to dry your hands is to reduce the necessity of washing them at all. With the introduction of the proximity sensor to porcelain wares - in contrast to proximity sensing air-blowers - a washless sojourn can be imagined. The automatic urinal has came around within my lifetime, and I’ve welcomed it’s ubiquity.</p>
<p>The potential downfall of this philosophy is that it is difficult to monitor exactly how unused our phalanges are after a romp in the water closet. It’s an unnecessary tight-rope to walk. During the writing of this essay, I was conducting a Sergey-inspired relief break when upon exit, I was confronted on my bypass of the sink and its subsequent chain reaction of interventions. This seemed like the perfect time to explain a marvellous new worldview to a interested audience. But the conversation turned heated when we failed to connect on what was metaphysically important in that public/private realm.</p>
<p>Luckily we don’t need to argue any more: all these trials have culminated into an end-point, the Dyson Airblade is it.<br>The device floors me with its innovation: hygienic, efficacious, and environmental. It’s usage requires no touching, so there is no viral by-proxy human contact. The sheer force of the air, because of it’s shape, does actually work as if a squeegee. Let us pause on this point, Dyson has made what amounts to hologrammed rubber, and this is superior as a matter of mechanical principle. Despite that it uses electricity to operate, it has no by products like paper, and so allows for relatively clear conscience in patronage, especially in conjunction with renewable energy.</p>
<p>The Dysonator does actually have it’s weak point: education on how to use it is almost a government secret. You are mostly encountering it in airports where acquiring skills isn’t top of mind. The instructions, if you notice them, are imprinted on its frame. They are a 2 point list. (1) To manoeuvre your hands into position to start, and (2) to shift them in the vertical plane. DONE. For the on-demand smartphone generation, though, these 2 steps are possibly one to many. (Remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uXJlX50Lj8" target="_blank" rel="external">iMac advert with no step three</a>? We’re a generation past that.) The second, which requires 12 seconds of slow moving tai-chi, was a paradigm shift for my twitter addled brain, which I’m thankful for miraculously discovering.  Now meditation is unlocking an arid world of pleasure for myself and my extremities.</p>

<p>This is my final project from my Machine Learning course this past semester. My collaborators and I attempted to find out when, and why users at English Wikipedia’s <em>article for deletion</em> forum, voted against their tendencies. That is, what makes an “deletionist” vote “keep” and when an “inclusionist” votes “delete”? In the end we found that basic machine learning techniques could not perform much better than random, but the intelligence that did emerge came from using information about group herding behaviour, and appeals to the local bureaucratic process.</p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a><a name="h.32keha5utgqx"></a>Introduction</h1><p>On 1 November 2015, English Wikipedia hit 5,000,000 articles; but while article creation is much celebrated, deleting an article is a lesser known process. Article for Deletion (AfD) is the forum where users discuss, make arguments about and and vote on articles’ inclusion in Wikipedia. A final decision is made by a more experienced user, based on the “consensus” of the debate. Over the years AfD has become a highly cultural process which has been likened to a playground game where children gather piles of leaves and are then judged for their raking ability (Baker).</p>
<p>Indeed, there are two groups at AfD that have statistically significant homogeneous voting patterns - the <span class="c15">inclusionists</span> and <span class="c15">deletionists</span> (Taborelli and Ciampaglia). Those groups argue sometimes over whether an article is encyclopedic in general, but also over whether an article fits Wikipedia’s unique policies (Geiger and Ford). Corroborating this Schneider et al. found that “acceptable arguments [at AfD] demonstrate knowledge of policies and community values”.</p>
<p>With the understanding that the large-scale dynamics at AfD are creating two camps of voters, and set of acceptable arguments, we ask what’s happening when users change their minds?</p>

<p><span class="c27">RQ: Can we predict when people will vote against their tendencies at AfD, and what factors are involved?</span></p>
<h1 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a><a name="h.4js1rbo8u0h2"></a>Method</h1><p>Methodologies of computer mediated group decision has been studied for a long time.  A decision-making group can benefit from pooling member’s information (<span class="c2">Stasser and William</span>). It can be viewed as a dynamic process that people make persuasions via information changes and rational arguments (<span class="c2">Herrera and Herrera-Viedma</span>). Therefore, we borrowed a well studied consensus model (see Appendix Figure 3), which uses the current consensus stage and the individual’s distance to social opinions to inform feature extraction from our collected dataset.</p>
<h2 id="Dataset-Descriptive-Statistics"><a href="#Dataset-Descriptive-Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Dataset Descriptive Statistics"></a><a name="h.ppxxheo3mylg"></a>Dataset Descriptive Statistics</h2><p>Our data comes from publicly accessible historical Wikipedia pages from 2005 to 2011, collected by Prof. Haiyi Zhu. It contains records of 23996112 votes in <span class="c21">363,201</span> deletion discussions between 81,112 editors. Appendix Figure 4 (a) is the distribution on number of participants versus the voting counts for delete and keep respectively. In order to get a clear signal we excluded the voters who participated less than 100 times in the AFD discussion, in which case 1,237,140 voting records remain, with <span class="c21">13,225 </span><span class="c21">editors on </span><span class="c21">363,104 articles</span>. As for the filtered records, a voter’s behavior is examined after their initial 100<span class="c21"> votes. Appendix </span><span class="c21">Figure 4(b)</span><span class="c21"> is the distribution on number of participants versus the voting counts for delete and keep respectively after filtering. Through this operation, the population sample falls into a smoother normal distribution. We believe the processed sample is more suitable for analysis because it represents that an equilibrium stage is reached for each voter as we assumed. </span></p>
<h2 id="Data-Extraction"><a href="#Data-Extraction" class="headerlink" title="Data Extraction"></a><a name="h.ygg56sacdgo4"></a>Data Extraction</h2><p>In preprocessing, we computed 1578 features for modeling. The features fall into two categories, 12 are descriptive features about the general discussion, like how conversation span, and number of participants (see Appendix Table 2 for complete details). The remaining features are the existence of a Wikipedia policy occurring in the discussion before the editor writes their comment. A Wikipedia Policy is a community practice codified into a Wiki page that is in a special namespace (whose name is the “Wikipedia” namespace). We filtered these policies out by searching for all links in the discussion text and then filtering on that special namespace. We then performed stemming, and redirect following, so that <span class="c15">Wikipedia:Notability (People)</span>. <span class="c15">Wikipedia:Notability (People)#Additional criteria</span>, and <span class="c15">WP:BIO</span> all are aggregated as the same policy. Since we found more than 1500 mentioned policies, but very few mentioned in any comment, we converted our data in a CSR-sparse matrix, otherwise our data did not fit into 8gb of memory.</p>
<p>As for our target variable, is <span class="c15">vote likelihood</span>, the probability<span class="c21">2</span> that an editor would make the current vote, based on their voting history. If a editor votes keep and their voting history is 75 keep / 25 delete, their <span class="c15">vote likelihood is 0.75</span>.</p>
<h2 id="Learning-Algorithms"><a href="#Learning-Algorithms" class="headerlink" title="Learning Algorithms"></a><a name="h.9lskoti89an6"></a>Learning Algorithms</h2><p><span class="c23">R</span><span class="c23">egression</span></p>
<p>The studied target is the voting likelihood , which is a continuous variable, and could be influenced by the other features stated above. Therefore, linear regression method is used to map all other features to the voting likelihood. The other features are linearly combined to predict the voting likelihood.</p>
<p>The next method we implemented is the logistic regression. Since we extracted the voters included in the data set participated more than 100 times, their behavior is considered stable based on Figure 4. Therefore, the two different classes that are split by 0.5 can be considered deletionists and inclusionists. The l2 norm is used to compute the penalty while the tolerance is 0.0001.</p>
<p><span class="c23">Classification</span></p>
<p>Since the voting likelihood is a continuous variable, in order to perform classification we split them into two different classes giving the threshold as 0.5.The class prior distributions is approximately 64% voting with history (vote likelihood &gt; 0.5) 36% voting against history (vote likelihood ≤ 0.5). Therefore, the following classification error rates should be compared with the 36% baseline a random classifier would perform.</p>
<p><span class="c19">Adaboost</span></p>
<p>The adaboost classifier is used where each base tree has 2 layers with a total of 500 trees. The learning rate is set to be 1. After calibration in Figure 3, we found the lower the learning rate, the lower the error rate.</p>
<p><span class="c19">Gradient Boost</span></p>
<p>We decided to run on 50% subsample of the total data for training since the error rate does not change significantly. Each base tree is also a 2 layers with a total of 500 trees. The learning rate is set to be 1.</p>
<h3 id="Random-Forest"><a href="#Random-Forest" class="headerlink" title="Random Forest "></a><a name="h.mzsazrts2qe5"></a><span class="c23">Random Forest </span></h3><p>We decided to execute random forest in order to conduct a feature selection process to show which were the most important features. Our forest size was 500 trees, each of depth 2, and selecting from 20 random features. We conducted this exercise three times to determine, how stable our data was under this process.</p>
<h1 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a><a name="h.tpxcbp9vc01t"></a>Results</h1><p>The results of the linear regression prediction is shown in Figure 4. The increasing black line is the theoretical line while the blue dots are the actual predicted value. As seen in the figure, linear regression’s result indicated nearly no predictive power over the entire data sets. Therefore, we decided to change the continuous variable regression problem into a binary class classification problem, whereas the different methods and results are shown below:</p>

<h1 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a><a name="h.gj4lisy01h86"></a>Discussion</h1><h2 id="Accuracy-in-prediction"><a href="#Accuracy-in-prediction" class="headerlink" title="Accuracy in prediction"></a><a name="h.k8qqop2t3cdg"></a>Accuracy in prediction</h2><p>Based on the class priors, a random guessing algorithm’s error rate will be 36%. Therefore, we use that number to evaluate our approaches. The best prediction according to the tables is 32% error rate which is only slightly better than random. The rest algorithms dwell around 36% error rate. This means that among all the features, none of them have significant predictive power to predict the changes of voters’ voting behavior. Logistic regression method produces 0.05% training error rate while the test error rate is nearly 36%. We suspect this behavior is a result of overfitting the datasets.</p>
<p>Although the overall predictive power is low, from random forest method, we are still able to recover the baseline test-error, and extract the top important features that act as a weak learners.</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_3963” align=”alignnone” width=”380”]<img src="http://notconfusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/image00.png" alt="Figure 2: Top 20 most important features from Random Forest."> Figure 2: Top 20 most important features from Random Forest.[/caption]</p>
<h2 id="Important-features"><a href="#Important-features" class="headerlink" title="Important features"></a><a name="h.hr4txcip3f59"></a>Important features</h2><p>We ran our random forest model 3 times which had a consistent error rate at 36.4%.  Running the algorithm 3 times did produce some jitter of the top 20 important features, but some features appeared consistently between runs (see table 1). We find that many of our non-policy features were consistently important in prediction.</p>
<p>In particular many temporal features were important, for instance that <span class="c15">conversation span</span> is important means that people change their opinions change more due to more conversation. Additionally <span class="c15">listing from first observation </span>is important so conversation happening at later dates have are less likely to have editors changing their minds.</p>
<p>Other important features show “herding” dynamics as was found in (Taborelli and Ciampaglia). All of <span class="c15">voters ahead,</span> <span class="c15">keep ahead. </span>and <span class="c15">consensus agreed</span> are important and this can be interpreted as that many people voting before will influence a voter to vote against their tendency. Specifically <span class="c15">keep ahead</span> means that if many people vote keep beforehand, a deletionist is likely to vote keep against their tendency. <span class="c15">Consensus agreed </span>means that a user voted in the same direction as the final decision, so this feature being important quite explicitly shows herding mentality.</p>
<p>In terms of policies that were consistently important we find many self-referential policies, that illustrate the importance of internal process. Firstly navel-gazing policies such as <span class="c15">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion, Wikipedia:Deletion process, Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point </span>and <span class="c15">Wikipedia:Non-admin </span><span class="c15">closure,</span> show that editors seeing appeals of AfD process will likely vote against their tendencies. We can call this the <span class="c15">policy wonk </span>effect, and it has been shown before in Schneider et al. “Newcomers are particularly likely to use certain common, but problematic, arguments, which are enshrined in policy and in essays such as Arguments to Avoid.”</p>
<p>Other features that showed important influence were notability guidelines:<span class="c15"> Wikipedia:Notability </span>[and it’s cousins],<span class="c15"> </span>and<span class="c15"> Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons. </span>Previous research has shown that the <span class="c15">notability </span>policies in specific are being increasingly cited at AfD (Lam and Reidl). Biography of Living persons is an especially instructive case, because these biographies have to be exceptionally conservative compared to Wikipedia’s regular standard due to United States defamation laws and legal liability of the Wikimedia Foundation. Therefore that people would change their standard voting behaviour in this sensitive area is unsurprising.</p>
<h1 id="Limitations"><a href="#Limitations" class="headerlink" title="Limitations"></a><a name="h.38laqgqtxkpj"></a>Limitations</h1><p>We only used the 100 votes or more for analysis and the converting threshold is set as 0.5. Yet this does not guarantee an absolute decision shift, for instance an only 49% likely vote.  A better algorithm for likelihood calculation can be adopted. For example, we can declare a voter’s equilibrium stage is reached  once his or her voting likelihood changes restricts in a small changing range for N consecutive votes rather than a fixed number.</p>
<p>Psychological effects in group discussion is not quantifiable in our model. One missing impacting factor is the choice supportive bias of individuals. It states that there <span class="c9">is the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one prefered. For example, when a person has preference on A over B, they are likely to downplay the faults of option A while amplifying those of option B.</span> Another limitation is the group bias, where irrational actions that is forbidden by an individual will be taken by when he/her is in a group.Yet, our current data does not have information to measure these effects. Since many temporal features seemed to be important, it would be good to investigate time-series based learning, as well.</p>

        <p>Since the beta version of  <a href="http://wigi.wmflabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">wigi.wmflabs.org</a>, our site dedicated to the biography gender gap on WIkipedia is progressing on the technical side, we decided  conducting usability study on to help improve interaction aspects. We conducted a usability study to find out more. It was fantastic to here people say ”this is the tool we’ve been waiting for,” and we also want to address issues that lead people to describe their experience as “burdensome”.  Thanks to <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Masssly" target="_blank" rel="external">Masssly</a> for compiling the report. I repost his summary here, and the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIGI_Usability_Study_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">full report can be read on wikimedia commons</a>:</p>
<h2 id="Executive-Summary"><a href="#Executive-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Executive Summary"></a>Executive Summary</h2><p>During the week of November 17 - December 1, 2015, WIGI was tested among participants pulled from the Wikimedia community, loosely described as anyone who edits Wikipedia-the-encyclopedia, or is a potential reader of any of its language versions. The study was carried out via separate video calls with each participant. Nine (9) participants in all took part in the study.<br>The main objective was to get feedback from the Wikimedia community about how the WIGI presents data, how it demonstrates what can be done with the data and how it makes open data-sets available for download. The study assessed participants’ perception of the content along with their understanding of the user interface and went ahead to evaluate the study participants’ reading enjoyment and overall user experience.</p>
<p>In general, <strong>67% of participants found the website web site to be uncluttered, straightforward and tidy.</strong> Whereas<br><strong>60% of the participants held that it was fun and easy to use</strong>, others thought that they spend too much time trying<br>to figure it out; <strong>one respondent described their experience as “burdensome”</strong>. All Five (5) participants who were video interviewed indicated that WIGI will help them further explore the gender gap in Wikipedia biographies. In their delight, one participant said that<strong> “I [now] have a deeper understanding of of the diversity and will make strong</strong><br><strong>arguments backed by statistics”</strong>. Another participant stated that<strong> ”this is the tool we’ve been waiting for.”</strong></p>
<p>Key problems identified in the study include:<br>• Difficulty to distinguish between Recent Changes and All Time displays<br>• Inflexible Recent Changes<br>• Lack of connection between between variables on the different pages<br>• Confusion over interpretation of charts<br>• Difficulty to gauge extent of measure (eg. percentages without figures, and vice versa)<br>• Use of presumptuous language and maths symbols<br>• Lack of data probing questions<br>Read <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIGI_Usability_Study_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">the full report</a> for more detail, get back to us <a href="http://twitter.com/notconfusing" target="_blank" rel="external">on twitter</a>, or <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wigi-project" target="_blank" rel="external">email</a>, if you have any more feedback.</p>

        <p>The very first time I heard it I was immediately convinced by Killer Mike’s un-festschrift “Reagan”. It’s a lucid, orchestrated, and damning exposé of what Reagan’s legacy has meant for less privileged people in America  “[…] thanks to Reaganomics, prisons turned to profits<br>Cause free labor is the cornerstone of US economics”. However as much I appreciate what Killer Mike spits, and specifically how he’s spitting it, I never felt I could fully connect with the message having never been directly effected by Reagan’s policies - until now.</p>

<p>This week my <a href="http://nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> application was “rejected without review.” The reason given was my application was not conforming to the submission standards, I hadn’t left 1 inch margins. It was true, I’d left 2cm margins (0.79 inches). It wasn’t a conscious decision, it was just technology ruling my life. As I keep Ubuntu’s language set to British English to avoid too many red underline squiggles in my life - Libre Office had defaulted to A4 papersize when I went to write my document.</p>
<p>Now the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#A_series" target="_blank" rel="external">A-series of paper sizes</a>, is a rather clever invention if you’ve not learned about it’s geometry. Each A<em>(n)</em> size is derived by folding A<em>(n-1)</em> in half AND every A<em>(n)</em> has exactly the same ratio of height to width 1:√2. The math is elegant. Fold 1:√2 in half and get 1:(√2 / 2) . Simplify by multiplying both sides by √2, and get √2<em>1: √2</em>(√2 / 2) √2:(2/2) = √2:1. Ingenious.  8½” by 11” on the other hand is about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192919/http://www.afandpa.org/paper.aspx?id=511" target="_blank" rel="external">Ronald Reagans’s domination and monocultural hegemony.</a></p>
<p>The point is that there are  subtle ways that technology decides our lives. Sometimes they are about automatic defaults in open source software; other times its about how bureaucratic rule, leads to governments codifying their cruel procedural-focus <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/episode/34-dmv-nation/" target="_blank" rel="external">into even worse websites</a>. Learn from my mistakes say I to myself, and beware any future NSFGRFP applicants who operate outside the mainstream.</p>

        <p>Perhaps because it’s not something I would have done on my own, thanks to the prodding of <a href="https://twitter.com/evomri" target="_blank" rel="external">Daniel Mietchen</a>, I  have created a data management plan for my <a href="http://notconfusing.com/am-i-doing-my-phd-in-the-open/" target="_blank" rel="external">open-PhD adventure</a>. What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management_plan" target="_blank" rel="external">data management plan</a> (DMP), you might ask? Now that I’m up to speed, I can tell you that it’s a document in which you set out the parameters for how you will create, share, and store the outcomes of a project. It’s also the sort of thing you go through in order to pose detail questions to yourself and make rigorous your otherwise slightly sloppy thinking.</p>
<p>Questions of the license to use for data produced were quite easy for me: I’m dedicated to using as open a license as possible while requiring attribution. Other topics however gave me pause in considering how I will handle the spew of data exhaust I produce all the time. For instance, documentation; how will I keep track of what those bits represent?</p>
<p>There is a large amount of hubris to sidestep with documentation. Thinking that I could keep a grand folder structure, or complete list seems like myopic optimism. I think there is some wisdom to draw from the casual obvservation that even as organizational tools online improve most coordination still gets done by plaintext emails. That’s why I have no plan to keep a megalist sort of card-catalogue of documentation, but to include it as files alongside the datae. I will aim for IPython/Jupyterized inline documentation of data handling when possible, but resorting to standard readme.md files in the directory otherwise. That is, I’ll be relying on search as a organisational principle, so the key will be making the barrier to searchable documentation as low as possible - like writing quick files.</p>
<p>On the question of archiving; how will I keep the data around for a long time? This posed a very difficult question for me because I wasn’t sure exactly how much longevity I want from my data. 2 years, 5 years, 20 years? Starting with needs-constraints rather than desires, I thought that storing my data should be easy and free (as in beer). That’s why I’m opting for using Github in the DMP. But there are two worries with Github, one is that it limits files to 100mb, so perhaps it’s not suitable for all possible data. The second concern is that Github is a company, like any other swashbuckler with venture-capitalism-driven bravado they could disappear easily. So then I thought that I might rely on some HTTP accessible servers at my University: no filesize limits, corporate independency, and tape backup storage. I am rather happy with those combinations, but if I wanted to invest a lot more effort for not a lot more benefit then I could nitpick at both of them being centrally managed regardless of profit motive. The only way to get around this would be to what? Create torrents of my data and seed them from personal servers. The idealist in me is tempted, but the time-scheduler sees the headache.</p>
<p>If you haven’t had to make a data management plan, I could understand that it seems rather abstruse and time consuming. However you should do it anyway because a) it forces you to think more closely about your data on an abstract level, and b) <a href="http://dmptool.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://dmptool.org/</a> makes it 50% less scarier than it needs to be. Oh and in the interest of openness after all, my DMP is here: <a href="http://notconfusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Open-PhD-data-management-plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Open-PhD data management plan.pdf</a>.</p>

        <p>In what will surely not be the last time I ask the U.S. government for money, I made the plea to be a fellow of theirs today. The Nation Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSFGRFP)  supports new PhD students in their research aims for 3 years.  And I am told, and also suppose, that I want that. The way in which they ask you to prostrate is a standard multi-essay plus recommendations mode. The essays, when viewed as “papers for which you haven’t done the work,” were useful writing and thought exercises. I am quite energized by firming up a proposal about what I might do in the next three years, even if it seems incomprehensibly difficult and moon-shot-ish  right now.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.theclimatecode.com/p/asdasd.html" target="_blank" rel="external">climate code</a> suggested that I ought to show how my research could have “multiple returns on investment.” I would like it if my application did as well. Perhaps publishing them in full here will have some good consequence in the future.</p>

<h2 id="Graduate-Research-Plan-Statement"><a href="#Graduate-Research-Plan-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Graduate Research Plan Statement"></a>Graduate Research Plan Statement</h2><p><strong>Blindspot: A Passive Implicit Bias Test From Digital Footprint</strong></p>
<p>Gender, race, sexuality, nationality, social-class, native-language, weight, etc. are causes of implicit and explicit social biases that affect human relationships, and in the worse case make life difficult for many.  For example, identical academic resumés with men’s names get offered more jobs with higher starting salaries than women’s (Moss-Racusin et al.). Similarly, physicians show a bias to attribute patient’s symptoms to coronary disease for blacks more than whites. Invetiably, social technologies transfer these biases (Friedman et al.), but their design can mitigate or exacerbate the transfer. In a negative example, photography tools have been optimized for taking pictures of white people (Dyer).  Meanwhile the internet has been a boon to the Gay Liberation movement by connecting people without fear of homophobia (Weinrich). However, the Human-Computer Interaction literature does not address these issues much (Kannabiran et al). That is a problem because social technology is an ever-growing component of our lives, and implicit biases are subtext to every transaction. Implicit bias is difficult to recognize because it cannot be seen with introspection (Kang, et al.). Without taking an implicit bias test one may remain unaware of the problem, and currently those tests require time and effort.<strong> I propose to build easier, more integrated, passive implicit bias tests by utilizing a person’s digital footprint.</strong> This proposal involves three parts; to operationalize bias from passive data, to create tools using that operationalization, and finally to evaluate those tools with a field study.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 1: Operationalize bias from passive data</em></strong></p>
<p>The first issue to tackle with this general approach is to be able to compute the implicit bias of a behaviour. The state of the art is the Implicit Association Test “IAT” (Greenwald et al. 1995), an isolated test-taking activity. My plan is to improve on the test by applying the notion to a person’s passive behaviour. I ask: can we treat the time reading combined topics as a passive test? For instance, if we know the content of a browsing history, and the time spent on each article, perhaps we already have the results of an implicit bias test. To evaluate the merit of our passive test we will correlate results with the IAT.</p>
<p>In comparing user and global biases I have been making inroads. In a recent project I built gender inequality indexes from the biographies of all Wikipedias by nationality. One result from this is that there is a high correlation between the nationality-index and the United Nation’s inequality index. As the UN measures inequality by position of power and education levels in countries, we know that so too do Wikipedia editors. I presented this finding at OpenSym ‘15 (Klein), and continuation of the work is now supported by a Wikimedia Foundation grant.</p>
<p>I am also experienced in finding novel measures for human behaviour. Borrowing from the economics literature I have suggested a measure of “collaborativeness” of a group of Wikipedia editors based on the articles they edit (Klein et al.). This is also an implicit bias check of sorts, it looks at the underlying propensity for users to collaborate, based on how different they are from a global norm. My familiarity with social bias data and repurposing methods will be key in building a theory of passive implicit bias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2: Create tools using that operationalization</em></strong></p>
<p>Once I develop a way to compute an implicit bias from a set of web pages, I would build a tool to allow any web user to monitor themselves. I envision this taking the form of a browser plug-in, that will, with permission, read and track your browser history. I will use the linked open data of the web - Wikidata, Freebase etc. - which provides semantic information on the internet at large for a “ground truth”. For instance if you are reading New York Times Opinion Pages, we will infer the amount of time spent reading about U.S. prison reform (domestic-interest &amp; Police Chief Garry McCarthy, male, age 56) vs. Canada’s Muslims in the upcoming election (foreign-interest, Muslim-interest, &amp; political elections). Over the scale on an entire browsing history, we can sum the time spent on and between different dimensions of bias.</p>
<p>To quell the issue of potential privacy violations this tool will be entirely open source, something with which I’m well acquainted. For instance I created a monitoring service which watches every edit on Wikipedia in realtime for citations, pings the author of the citation, and uploads any open access articles for link reliability. Seeing the benefit in this Crossref offered financial support to expand and maintain this service (Bilder). Thus my skills in building realtime tools for social good is already advanced.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3: Evaluate those tools with a field study</em></strong></p>
<p>The last stage of this proposal would be to conduct a field study of how well this implicit bias tool works. We would seek a stratified sample to install and use the browser plugin. Next, we would monitor participants at intervals, determining if being aware of their bias scores affects their future bias score. We must control for factors such as having browsing history monitored, and the frequency of seeing implicit bias scores. To test the method’s efficacy we would correlate results with standard implicit bias scores. I am at the beginning of my training in conducting field study. This is why I chose my advisor Dr. Haiyi Zhu, a computer scientist with ample experience in the area. At the moment we are embarking on an interview study on Couchsurfing and AirBnB, in which I am learning the interview skills and interactive methods crucial to field study.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong></p>
<p>This work put together - successful or not - would advance the fields of human-centered computer science and implicit social bias research. Our first step, to create a passive implicit bias test based on a digital footprint, will contribute by improving implicit bias measurement methods. Our tool-building will provide another return on investment by enriching the linked-open-data community with an open bias dataset, a dimension at the moment which is entirely missing. In total, the project successfully completed would mean a novel, unprecedentedly easy implicit bias check, usable by anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Broader impact</strong></p>
<p>This proposed work can help unlock technology’s potential to reduce implicit social bias (e.g.,  gender, race, sexuality, nationality) and equalize society. We are attempting to build a “one-click solution”, so that time and technical barriers to test one’s own implication are as low as possible. Thus the broadest swathe of society will be able look into a mirror of their own bias. Yet, another aspect of creating a more equal society lies in access to research. As someone that was an unaffiliated researcher before re-entering the academy, I know the value of Open Access work, as it was all I had for years. I have a data management plan in place to publish all papers and non-privacy-sensitive documents (including this one), under open licenses. I am already an attender of Open Knowledge Festival, and was a Featured Speaker at Wikimania 2015. By advocating for open access research I’m promoting the spread of knowledge above prestige and profit, and eventually a more egalitarian world.</p>

The first time I awoke to my implicit, internalised racism a mix of discomfort and amazement overcame me. It was during a protest on the civil-rights-famous steps of Sproul Hall in Berkeley, where after a few rebel-rousing speeches a black woman came to the stage and started delivering activist poetry. I had been brought up to think of myself as not racist, and yet in a rare moment of self-awareness I saw myself dismissing her content because of how she spoke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the world-shattering realization of how we can hide prejudices from ourselves, subsequent prejudices came to light more rapidly. My own misogyny became very real upon a reading of favourite academic Joseph Reagle’s “<a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4291/3381" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Free as in Sexist</em></a><em>,” </em>(Reagle) a deconstruction of sexism in Open Culture. (Of course it took a man to show me that.) I lost religious dogma at the holocaust memorials in Berlin and Auschwitz, when I saw that accepting any unquestioned message is dangerous. Only last month the <a href="http://talkinreckless.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">blog of a woman</a> I met at a wedding introduced me to the “fat stigma” I had unwittingly been harbouring (“Talkin Reckless”). These continuous epiphanies fuel my wonder at just how many unidentified stigmas I’m still holding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feeling I get from a solid attack on my belief-system is so powerful that chasing after it has become the driving force in my life. Now I want it to be my career. I want to use research methods promote a more equitable society by uncovering and addressing implicit stigmas. I foresee my future as working with an organization or think-tank, likely non-profit, who also focuses on equality issues. Whether by grant or employment, it is of paramount importance that I work with a social justice-oriented team. My past experience in working in that sector has been overwhelmingly positive. Yet owing to the fact that this line of work is more self-directed and typically outside large corporate structure, advancing my career will mean I need to become more independent as researcher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After having worked as a self-employed developer and researcher the last two years, I see graduate studies as a best path to enabling my personal development. Past experience has shown me that I need to learn a larger swathe of research methods. For my particular project - building a tool to unearth implicit bias from browsing habits - I need to learn the ways in which people are best convinced. And I am also looking for graduate school to partner me with others doing similar things. Together, mastering technical methods, delving into psychology, and working within the landscape, will give my goal of exposing implicit bias the broadest possible impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I learned how to both borrow and re-use theory from other fields, and to take initiative on projects during my work on “The Virtuous Circle of Wikipedia” (Klein et al.). </strong>While volunteering at the Wikipedia booth during a poster session at UC Berkeley, a conversation quickly turned into a collaboration.  An economist asked me to provide Wikipedia data for testing economic complexity theory in that domain. Being mentored by my coauthor Maillart – who would describe himself as an “econo-physicist” – I  learned what it means to generalize findings and theories across domains. That has been an inspiration, as I now see the rich potential of exploring and reading outside computer science. The story continues as I also understood more about research collaboration dynamics. When the project started slipping behind schedule, I took the initiative to create a plan to finish on time by managing my superiors, assigning them task-lists, as well as plowing on with the  analysis myself. Thus they awarded me with first-authorship on the paper. That has brought me to the next challenge of completely leading a research effort, which I think graduate school can teach me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am prepared to manage a team, but see my relative paucity in methods of persuasion from “Wikipedia Indicators of Gender Inequality (WIGI)” (Klein and Konieczny), a grant</strong> <strong>I won from Wikimedia Foundation. </strong>The aim of WIGI is to provide a series of inequality indexes like the United Nations Gender Inequality Index based off Wikipedia and including time, ethnicity, and occupation dimensions. When correlated to other indexes it can tell us both about the world and Wikipedia (Klein). On the back of that poster and paper, I won a grant from the Wikimedia Foundation to make the dataset available as a service. As the principal grantee, I manage a paid team of 4, which has taught me the lessons of how to lead without pushing. At first I erred in being to Laissez-faire in trusting employees to be self-directed, and later settle on a more accountable weekly-homework model.</p>
<p>We’ve produced a <a href="https://github.com/notconfusing/WIGI" target="_blank" rel="external">prototype</a>, which will make it much easier for other researchers to include inequality as a dimension in their projects. Yet, even though we have made this dataset, I am still at quite a loss of how to announce it and persuasively “sell” the research – another skill that graduate school can teach me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Having been engaged in exemplary models of collaboration during my time as Research Assistant at OCLC, and a grantee of Creative Commons, I know the value of community.</strong></p>
<p>“If you want to go fast you go alone; if you want to go far you go together,” I recall the CEO Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) saying in a company address. Founded in 1967, they are ancient by tech standards, but their long-term vision taught me what it meant to me a community member. During my time there as a research assistant I found an opportunity to use their bibliographic data to enrich Wikipedia’s articles. Having racked up over 2 million edits, I published about the process with help from the tight-knit librarian community (Klein and Kyrios).  My experience from OCLC in thinking about multiple stakeholders, and industry standards, is how I came to win a grant from Creative Commons to create a plug-in to include the technology of the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI) in MediaWiki sites. Working with the LRMI board, and MediaWiki developers closely, we came to a win-win implementation, that will make highly searchable Google results of Open Educational Resources (Campbell). It was a big lesson to work with many people, but that sometimes slower pace pays off in the longevity of results. With my graduate studies I hope to find a network of colleagues with whom “to go far.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping sight of my overall goal to spread awareness of implicit bias, it is easy to explain how the trajectory of my experience will make a broad impact in society. Being privy to your own blind-spots, is difficult, if not paradox by definition. Yet, it is that difficulty which makes it such a worthy project. In fact to the western rationalist mind, paradox is often an indicator of faulty underpinnings. Those who are least affected by implicit bias are, not by coincidence, the most privileged in society. And the most privileged in society have an opportunity to change it. As someone who, more than not, is privileged, I feel it my responsibility to use my position, potential, and energy to continue bring the issue of inequality to light. There is no need for me to<em> translate</em> how my work and history will broadly impact society, because my work and history<em> is about</em> the broad unequal impacts in society.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Yesterday I clicked on a JSTOR link, and a full text PDF popped up - it wasn’t an Aaron Schwarz liberation plan. I was in the academy reading closed access research. I’m in the academy, and I’m on the precipice of taking it for granted.</p>
<p><a href="http://notconfusing.com/should-i-do-my-phd-in-the-open/" target="_blank" rel="external"> Last November</a> I asked if I should do my PhD in the open and answered in the affirmative, but at that point I hadn’t even been accepted by any PhD-granting institutions. Only one month into ensconcing myself in the <a href="http://grouplens.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">GroupLens lab</a>, at the Univ. of Minnesota, I somehow forgot about the my commitment to openness. It is time to right that.</p>
<p>Dropping onto the conveyor belt of academia has been surprisingly strengthening. The factor that I expected to aid my moonshot research goals - being in a group of like-minded peers - is working just as planned. I wasn’t even put off by the PhD “retreat” this week, a Chipotle-catered 4 hour meeting, wherein they told us that the name of the game was publish or perish, to work hard to aggrandize the legacies of our advisors, and that we had to keep up with CMU. I believed the faculty when they said that our success was their success and vice-versa. Perhaps I’m absorbing the Minnesota nice, or maybe it’s just that reassuring to finally be part of a team. While the scare-tactics are minimal and the amiability and cooperative nature of the group remains as authentically high as it is - I’ve found what I was looking for in a cohort.</p>
<p>The knock-on factor that I didn’t anticipate being as useful as it is, is being taught. Since my last employment in 2013, I’ve dedicated my efforts to self-learning teacherless autodidacticism. But now I’m re-exploring the benefits, and detriments of external tutelage. My few courses, Human-Computer Interaction Methods, Machine Learning, and Introduction to Research, and spanning the gamut of how a classroom affects knowledge.</p>
<p>The HCI Methods course is precisely the high-level, just-a-bit-of-guidance I was anticipating from graduate study. It has been eye-opening to receive a systematic overview of ‘methods’, of the many “Ways of Knowing in HCI,” as our textbook is titled. I’m shown exactly how to start walking, as a crawling being.</p>
<p>Particularly in realm of so-called qualitative research, the questions I didn’t know I had about how to do it well are rising and getting answered. One pain point is is for me to treat a quality-focus as an intellectually rigorous path. I am having difficulty with the challenge of unlearning the hard/soft, hard/easy, good/bad, false spectra and associations. I must overcome my bias, and I think that just might happen in time because if I look at empirical evidence, in the lab there is no disparaging of anyone’s work, only louder and louder applauding.</p>
<p>On the other hand this Machine Learning class is a curse of recidivist pedagogy. All of a sudden the pointless constructs of midterms, final exams and grace days return. The content the class is supposed to teach is perfectly delicious. The way it’s brought to the table is all the wrong parts of the confusion of education and schooling. I’m not too old for it, simply have lost all my appetite for people-pleasing. My advisor reminds that I must only appease to the minimum degree. I less and less see the point in even playing the game half-heartedly.</p>
<p>Upon turning in my first homework I remarked inwardly that I hadn’t cared so little about a program I’d written since I quit computer science in undergrad studies. And then I saw a theme recurring. It goes deep. I failed Math in high school, but it became my major in college. I failed computer science in college, but it became my the subject of my graduate studies. Well that’s what an administrator would say. I prefer the frame that in both cases I didn’t fail the subject, but failed to be subjected by the schooling. Today I’m facing that conundrum once again, and hope to develop a better coping mechanism than my previous pyrrhic stalemates.</p>
<p>My third class, which I might rename “Learn You a Research”, is a seminar of sorts, emphasising my independence as a researcher. It has the right aims of assistance, and solidifying fundamentals. The semester-long project is to write a literature review to be proud of, and that’s something that (a) I would be doing anyway, and (b) am pleased to think a bit more intentionally about. In fact, the topic of that review is due today, and I shall be submitting, in the name of an Open PhD is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Survey Topic: Trust and Discrimination in the Sharing Economy.</p>
<p>Focus: My goal is to review online systems and mechanisms used for establishing trust, and using the lens of design, consider how they effect discrimination.<br>That needs a bit of work in it’s precise formulation, but it correctly surfaces my personal fascinations with implicit bias and peer-to-peer technologies. It is also meant to marry those ideas with those of my advisor, Haiyi Zhu, who is intriguing with the new-to-me domain of the sharing economy and a more formalized notion of trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pursuing her and collaborator Mako Hill’s very simpatico agenda, we’ve set out on a project that I wouldn’t have considered on my own. It is an interview-based inquiry into hosts and guests that use both AirBnB and CouchSurfing (and other “network hospitality” sites); about when they would use one and not the other, and what that means for the co-existence of the sites, and their underlying ideologies.</p>
<p>This project has me hyped and nervous at the same time. Hyped because it hones on interrogating this “Capitalism kills love” lens to which I’ve been inculcated - and I’m addicted to inspecting my own assumptions. Nervous because it represents the start of my doing purely “qualitative” work (if you believe binary). The world is fresh and new - I am filing my first IRB request - which has involved learning what an IRB even is. It’s got me saying “I’ve never done that before, but I’ll do my best,” a very good phrase to be saying at this juncture.</p>
<p>Moreso, it has me nervous on another level, trying to conduct this research in the open. As much as I have been enjoying my new comrades, I have not heard much discussion of Open Access research. Conducting this one with one of the co-founders of Ubuntu, we will use a private git repo for collaboration - which is a start. I’m still embarrassed to make a fuss in my lab, but at the same time I want to be clear to with I’m as open-source, as open-data, open-access as possible. I still feel a fear of being a nagging, naïve newbie. That I suppose is just baby step #2, of doing my PhD in the open.</p>
<p>So there you have it, all I have done in my PhD so far - just my thoughts - opened. While I’m being confessional, there is one more thing. I wrote a letter which lives in my desk draw that’s titled “Failure Plan”. It says to go on a long walk, and then reinvestigate ways to try again.</p>
