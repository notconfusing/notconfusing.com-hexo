Traffic to the data visualizations increased 500% on the day of the BBC publication to 1,000 views/day, which inspires confidence. Moreover, Wikimedia Foundation’s Grants team—who funded WHGI—<a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Evaluation/Inspire_Campaigns/Gender_gap/What" target="_blank" rel="external">praised the project in their year-end report,</a> saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grants for research and tools (such as WHGI) - which minimally contribute to the targets of people or articles - have been extremely valuable in improving our understanding of the gender gap and how or why it manifests.<br>Among the uses I’ve seen online, the most reported statistic seems to be the progression of the female ratio of biographies in English Wikipedia: increasing to 16.78% by end of 2016 from approximately 15% in the two years we’ve been measuring. Seeing this interest, in the future I would plan to build better longitudinal visualizations. So we might see exactly how this statistic (and all others) have changed week-on-week throughout WHGI’s history.  Additionally, using anomaly detection to automatically call out large spikes and drops in Wikidata, would be a good service to the community. I hope in 2017 I’ll have some time to roll-out more advanced analytics in store for measuring Wikipedia’s systemic biases.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h2 id="So-you-want-to-upload-an-image-to-the-cloud-with-Node-js"><a href="#So-you-want-to-upload-an-image-to-the-cloud-with-Node-js" class="headerlink" title="So you want to upload an image to the cloud with Node.js?"></a>So you want to upload an image to the cloud with Node.js?</h2><p>Maybe you want a small raspberry pi webcam to take timelapse footage and send it to a server every hour because of its small harddrive. Maybe you want to build a social network swapping images of Lizard People, and your sever can t handle all the image traffic. Maybe you want to back-up your irreplaceable collection of dead-sea scroll fragments – it’s irreplaceable. You  might want to keep around images or files for many different reasons, and having them publicly accessible in the cloud is better than trying to manage them yourself, for storage and network reasons. This is a tutorial about how to do that. In this tutorial we will be building and inspecting a use case for a web-app I’ve been working on in which users can post images of items they want to trade.</p>
<p>Just focusing on the backend, we’ll be assuming there’s already webpage with a file upload user-interface. What we’ll be doing is creating the API endpoint that images can be uploaded to, but will then turn-around and ask a cloud-strorage provider to hold the image for us. We’ll also make a square thumbnail version of the image and upload those too. Once both of these images (the full-size and the thumbnail) are in the cloud, we’ll return to the web-client a URL of where the images can be found in the cloud.</p>
<p><img src="http://notconfusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-drawing1.png" alt="Architectural Overview"></p>
<h2 id="Choices-choices"><a href="#Choices-choices" class="headerlink" title="Choices, choices"></a>Choices, choices</h2><p>Let’s take a moment to justify the technologies we are using. The first is node.js. There’s a Ph.D. student who works at my university researching programming languages who starts all of his presentations with the question: “why on earth does anyone write in node.js?” It’s funny the first few times you hear it, and if you’re like me who fell in love with python, you might be reticent. But there is some justification here, although some of our processing needs to happen synchronously, but a lot doesn’t, so nodeJS’s asynchronous-by-default nature will be useful.</p>
<p>The next question we have to answer is, which cloud storage provider to use. I investigated a couple of candidates, and eventually settled on using Microsoft’s Azure, because it came with some excellent sample applications and code that made it easy to get off the ground in an hour. It’s not the only one out there though, I also thought about Amazon S3 the popular giant - but its popular enough already. I looked at Google Cloud Services, which does come with node.js wrappers which is nice, but I didn’t see any sample applications so it wasn’t as dev-friendly as it could have been. I also wanted to consider companies that weren’t corporations of sizes I can’t even fathom, so I poked around Rackspace’s promising offerings, but their documentation was written entirely in cURL exmaples, and we’re trying to play this game on easy mode. Lastly, Cloudinary seems like a good service which is more purpose-build for images, not just general storage, and so has a built-in thumbnail API. I wish my colleague had told me about Cloudinary before I’d written this tutorial not after, it may have come out differently.</p>
<p>One last thing to note is how much these services cost, what I noticed is that their pricing structures were more similar than different. $0.003 per GB of traffic matters to Netflix, not to us for these purposes.</p>

<h2 id="Set-up"><a href="#Set-up" class="headerlink" title="Set up"></a>Set up</h2><p>For this toturial you’ll need a Microsoft Azure account. They’ll give you $200 free credit to start off, so go sign-up at <a href="http://portal.azure.com" target="_blank" rel="external">http://portal.azure.com/ </a>without entering a credit card, and setup your “Blob” storage.</p>

Note, the Key icon which contains your secret key needed for later on.[/caption]</p>
<p>Now we’ll move on to getting our node.js enviorment set up. With the magic of <code>npm</code> this is remarkably easy. In your project folder do</p>
<p><pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="shell">npm install azure-storage –save</pre><br>As I mentioned Azure’s storage solution not only has a node.js library, but also comes with a nice simple <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/blob/c98fd8ff9310f688a7ff6a227015876cd1f722ab/examples/ASM/samples/continuationsample.js" target="_blank" rel="external">sample application </a>which I’ll embellish and go over in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="Breaking-the-Code"><a href="#Breaking-the-Code" class="headerlink" title="Breaking the Code"></a>Breaking the Code</h2><p>We’re ready to look at some code. What you’re about to see is inside an <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">express application </a>which I won’t cover now. If you’re not familiar with express it’s quite easy to pick up, but for now pay attention to the broad strokes.</p>
<p><pre class="EnlighterJSRAW">var azure = require(‘azure-storage’);<br>var formidable = require(‘formidable’);<br>//for parsing data that comes with our images<br>var lwip = require(‘lwip’);<br>//to make our thumbnails<br>const storageAccount = ‘youenteredthisatazureportal’<br>const storageAccessKey = ‘alongrandomstringyougetfromazure’<br>const azureEndpoint = ‘<a href="https://OURDOMAIN.blob.core.windows.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://OURDOMAIN.blob.core.windows.net/</a>‘<br>const containerName = ‘youenteredthisatazureportal’;</pre></p>
<p>var blobClient = azure.createBlobService(storageAccount, storageAccessKey);<br>We now have the the blobClient which is an Object that has a method which will accept our image and upload it, keep this in mind. Next we’ll plumb in our API to respond to HTTP POST requests at <code>/uploadhandler</code>.</p>
<p><pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">router.post(‘/uploadhandler’, function (req, res) {<br>  var form = new formidable.IncomingForm();<br>  var itemId = new Date().getTime()<br>  form.parse(req, function (err, fields, files) {<br>      var options = {<br>        contentType: ‘image/jpeg’,<br>        metadata: {fileName: itemId}<br>        }<br>      var imgPath = files.image.path<br>      var machineId = fields.machineId<br>      var userName = fields.userName<br>      makeThumb(imgPath, itemId, machineId, userName, options, res, uploadThumb);<br>      uploadFull(imgPath, itemId, options)<br>  });<br>});</pre><br>In this example we are expecting a <code>form</code>  which contains our image in the <code>files.image</code> attribute, and some other data like <code>machineId</code> and <code>userName</code> which came along for the ride in fields of the form. After that’s all parsed, we are going to make a thumb, and we’re sending it the callback <code>uploadThumb</code> to run afterwards. <code>uploadFull</code> doesn’t need any preprocessing so we can send it on it’s merry way right now, giving it the image path and an <code>itemId</code> which basically serves as a unique-enough-for-now name for our file. We also are giving Azure some clues as to what this data is that we’re sending it in the  <code>options</code> object. For simplicity we’re assuming its a jpeg.</p>
<p>I bet you’re wondering what those upload functions do?</p>
<p><pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">var uploadFull = function(imgPath, itemId, options){<br>  var fileName = itemId + ‘.jpg’<br>  blobClient.createBlockBlobFromLocalFile(containerName, fileName, imgPath, options, function (error) {<br>    if (error != null) {<br>      console.log(‘Azure Full Error: ‘, error)<br>    } else {<br>      console.log(‘Azure Full Success’)<br>    }<br>  });<br>}</pre><br><code>uploadFull</code> is going take our image file and plug it into the blobClient’s <code>createBlockBlobFromLocalFile</code> method. It takes a callback to know how to handle errors. Actually this a weak point of Azure that I’ll cover later, about why what arguments passed to this callback are insufficient. But lets take a moment here some magic happened. blobClient is abstracting away a lot of HTTP-based complexity for us–thanks Azure SDK.</p>
<p>Now let’s see how to make make a square thumbnail out of our image, and at the same time uncover a gripe I have about azure’s SDK.</p>
<p><pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">var makeThumb = function(imgPath, itemId, machineId, userName, options, res, callback){<br>  lwip.open(imgPath, ‘jpg’, function(err, image){<br>    image.cover(320, 320, function(err, image){<br>      image.toBuffer(‘jpg’, function(err, buffer){<br>        callback(buffer, itemId, machineId, userName, options, res)<br>      });<br>    });<br>  });<br>};</pre><br>We use the aptly named <a href="https://github.com/EyalAr/lwip" target="_blank" rel="external">“LightWeight Image Processing” library </a>, to make a 320x320 pixel thumbnail. There is actually a single call that will do this in <code>image.cover</code> . But notice that we passed in a string representing a path and what we got back was a buffer. We could have saved the image as a file, but what’s the point in cloud upload if you’re going to save the files locally?</p>
<p>At this point we have an image as a buffer and we want to push this to Azure too.</p>
<p><pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">var uploadThumb = function(buffer, itemId, machineId, userName, options, res){<br>  var fileName = itemId + ‘_thumb.jpg’<br>  blobClient.createBlockBlobFromText(containerName, fileName, buffer, options, function (error) {<br>    if (error != null) {<br>      console.log(‘Azure Thumb Error: ‘, error)<br>      res.send({sucess:false})<br>    } else {<br>      console.log(‘Azure Thumb Success’)<br>      anItem = {itemid: itemId,<br>               machineid:machineId,<br>               label:’Unlabeled’,<br>               username:userName<br>               thumbURL:azureEndpoint+fileName}<br>      res.send({success:true, item:anItem});<br>    }<br>  });<br>};</pre><br>Luckily blobClient has another method <code>createBlockBlobFromText</code> which can handle this buffer and work its magic again. Finally if we get success back from the thumbnail upload, we can tell that <code>res</code> response object we’ve been passing around to send some metadata back to the client, so they can know what happened to their image upload. They can use the <code>thumbURL</code> attribute to know where to look for a thumbnail online.  And we’re done. QED.</p>
<h2 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h2><p>Azure’s SDK made our image uploading easy, but with close analysis there is a some room for improvement. The first thing to notice, which is mentioned earlier is that the callback that the blobClient methods require is one that takes <code>err</code> as its only argument. I would feel better about my life is they would also send back some data about where the blob got stored. It’s true that you can piece it together because it _should _be at <code>azureEndpoint+fileName</code>, but I would have more (ahem) piece of mind if it returned this URL to me.</p>
<p>The real annoyance is that blobClient has two separate methods for dealing with file paths and text buffers. One method that could either infer these two cases, or provide a specifier as an optional argument makes more sense to me. If it were so, it would allow us more easily to write higher-level functions using the blobClient for many different operations.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope you learned to node, to upload, and to Azure for great good.  This sketch walked us through making an account with Azure and then linking in the Azure SDK with Express. They have many good <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-nodejs-how-to-use-blob-storage" target="_blank" rel="external">resources themselves at Microsoft Developer Network</a>. Without confusion, signing off.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Marriage is part of humanity. As Alain de Botton reflected, “[…] the impulse to cluster into small familial groups within which to safely propagate the next generation, is a project that has been known to the largest share of humanity since our earliest upright days in East Africa’s Rift Valley.” And although today Harry and Carie are engaged in this ancient tradition, they are also alternative people that create their own history. Alternative people who appreciate a form of never-ending play, which was has been so well described for myself and our couple in the book <em>Finite and Infinite Games.</em> I’d like to read to you it’s philosophy on marriage, the family project and their choiceful natures:</span></span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Infinite lovers may or may not have a family. No family is united by natural or any other kind of necessity. Families can convene only out of choice. The family of infinite lovers has this difference, that it is self-evidently chosen. It is a progressive work of unveiling. Fathering and mothering are roles freely assumed but always with the design of showing them to be theatrical. It is the intention of parents in such families to make it plain to their children that they all play cultural and not societal roles, that they are only roles, and that they are all truly concrete persons behind them. Therefore, children also learn that they have a family only by choosing to have it, by a collective act to be a family with each other.</span></span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">I feel very strongly in your relationship, Harry and Carie that you are “collectively choosing” as people. You choose to pick mushrooms. To craft together. To cook together. To go to burning man. To create a jungle of plants in your home. To find the right house. To marry. It almost seems like it couldn’t be any other way. Until you consider what it can be like for another couple to pinball, jump, react, zap or wriggle into position. Your negotiations are smooth, so smooth as to be almost imperceptible. That is your magic. For people that know you, they know the way your joint decisions congeal, as if a biochemical process in nature. Saying that “you two were meant for each other” feels to me cliché, but saying “you are a natural couple” does not.</span></span></span></p>

        <p>The Economist has commented on the irony that machine learning helps school teachers relax after work by choosing what movie to watch,<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21705329-governments-have-much-gain-applying-algorithms-public-policy" target="_blank" rel="external"> but helps none in determining how to assist their students</a>. In my fellowship this summer, I tried to change that. At <a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">DSSG</a>, I worked with the Tulsa Public Schools to do identify which students are at risk of being made to repeat 3rd grade. Using machine learning techniques we were able to predict 95% of the second grade students that would require intervention before the <a href="http://sde.ok.gov/sde/reading-sufficiency" target="_blank" rel="external">Reading Sufficiency Act </a>destined them to do the year over.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I have been investigating profiles of users of <em>Airbnb</em> and <em>Couchsurfing</em> this year as research into personality differences between users of market- and socially-based network hospitality websites. Along the way I have uncovered some suggestive data supporting a rumor that Couchsurfing may have been manipulating the size of its user-base through fake profiles.</p>
<p>After I had assembled datasets of these user’s publicly viewable data, I started to take a look at the <em>sign-up dates</em> of each profile to gauge the ages of the user bases. In  inspecting the Couchsurfing set, I found an usual spike in sign-ups in 2013.</p>
<p>Conducting a web search for reasons why this would be I queried the web “what happened to Couchsurfing in 2013”. There is a murmur on the Wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing#Demographics" target="_blank" rel="external">that fake profiles have existed for a long time in order to inflate membership statistics</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://notconfusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cs_screen.png" alt="cs_screen"></p>
<p>The  citation for this claim points to a couchsurfing.org blog from September 2013, which now 404’s, and neither the Google cache nor the Wayback machine have record of it.</p>
<p>However the data tells a story of its own . The graph below shows, as of May 2016, of Couchsurfing profiles with status “Accepting guests”, in which year they signed up and what is their “trust level”.  The “trust level” measures if a profile shows verification, or if a profile has at least one reference.</p>
<p><img src="http://notconfusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/couchsurfing_trust-1-1024x768.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is clearly visible that the increase of profiles in 2013 is not accompanied by a similar spike in profiles with verification or references. I imagine that a fake profile would have neither of these. Therefor this seems to be suggestive data supporting the fake profile hypothesis - that at least 40,000 additional profiles, which have no verification or references, were  created in 2013.</p>
<p>The year 2013 is an interesting time for such profiles to have been created, since it was soon after the company received venture capital funding<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/76288ecb39210e2cb0aca90d62307820" target="_blank" rel="external"> in August of 2012.</a> Whether or not the change in ownership had some hand in this suspicious activity is speculation, but certainly the idea that Couchsurfing has been changing recently bears out in the data.</p>

        <p>Note: This post is quite old. In fact Wikidata can now be accessed “properly” via the <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Wikidata Query Service (WDQS). </a>However the techniques outlined below still have their advantages.</p>
<p>The inaugural <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Labs2/Hackathons/November_9th,_2013" target="_blank" rel="external">Wiki Research Hackathon </a> went very well, and I’m affirmed that I feel best when I’m conducting Wiki Research. I was asked to give one of the tech talks of the day about accessing Wikidata data programmatically. Here is an outline of the talk</p>
<h3 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose:"></a>Purpose:</h3><p>We’ll be viewing Wikidata as file in its own right for research, not as it’s canonical use case of being used in various Wikipedias.</p>
<h3 id="Native-format"><a href="#Native-format" class="headerlink" title="Native format:"></a>Native format:</h3><p>Wikidata is a mostly standard Mediawiki instance except that pages don’t store “Wikitext”, they store JSON blobs. (If you want to understand more about this abstraction, see then <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:ContentHandler" target="_blank" rel="external">ContentHandler</a>).</p>

### 3 Ways To Access Wikidata:

Whether your more comfortable in object-oriented python, parsing large text files, or munging linked data, there is something for you.

*   Live, from the API, using [pywikibot](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/Wikidata)

    *   Read / write

*   Offline, dumps, using Wikidata Toolkit (wdtk)

    *   Newer, shinier, performant Java

            *   [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Toolkit](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Toolkit)

        *   Deprecated, slower, unmaintained python "Wikidata Analyzer"

            *   [https://github.com/mkroetzsch/wda](https://github.com/mkroetzsch/wda)

        *   Read only

*   As linked data, entities, via content negotiation

    *   Read only

### Using Pywikibot:

With pywikibot you get almost full support of the API.
New classes in the “core” branch
class WikibasePage(Page):
class ItemPage(WikibasePage):
class PropertyPage(WikibasePage):
class Claim(PropertyPage):
Using Pywikibot
Classic pywikibot pagegenerators work.
#make a generator for all the pages with a property
en_wikipedia = pywikibot.Site('en', 'wikipedia')
wikidata = en_wikipedia.data_repository()
property_page = pywikibot.ItemPage(wikidata, 'Property:P21')
pages_with_property = property_page.getReferences()

#### Pywikibot example:

I've been harvesting Infobox Book across many languages and writing the corresponding properties to Wikidata [https://github.com/notconfusing/harvest_infobox_book](https://github.com/notconfusing/harvest_infobox_book).

### Using wda

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Update: WDA is deprecated and replaced by Wikidata Toolkit, which I explain how to use with code examples [in this blog post.](http://notconfusing.com/sex-ratios-in-wikidata-part-iii/ "Sex Ratios in Wikidata Part III")</span>

WDA, WikiData Analytics, downloads the official dump and analyzes it offline. Cleverly it uses nightly incremental dumps after about a 10GB first download. It's also written in python, mainly by Markus Kroetzsch.After downloading there is a parser that writes a file called kb.txt. kb.txt stores plaintext triples, one per line giving you something like this.
<pre>Q21 link {trwiki:İngiltere} .
Q21 link {hewiki:אנגליה} .
Q21 alias {en:ENG} .
Q21 alias {min:Inggirih} .
Q21 alias {sgs:England} .
Q21 P31 Q1763527 .
Q21 P47 Q22 .
Q21 P47 Q25 .
Q21 P41 {Flag of England.svg} .

I used wda to in my analysis of [the most unique Wikipedias according to Wikidata](http://notconfusing.com/the-most-unique-wikipedias-according-to-wikidata/ "The Most Unique Wikipedias According To Wikidata").</pre>

<h3 id="Content-Negotiation"><a href="#Content-Negotiation" class="headerlink" title="Content Negotiation:"></a>Content Negotiation:</h3><p>You can also access Wikidata as linked data. The build path is:</p>
<pre>https://wikidata.org/entity/&lt;QID&gt;.&lt;format&gt;</pre>
where your choices of format are
<pre>nt
rdf
ttl</pre>
Content Negotiaton Example
<pre>https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/Q42046.ttl @prefix entity: &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/&gt; . @prefix wikibase: &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/ontology#&gt; . @prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; . @prefix skos: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#&gt; . @prefix schema: &lt;http://schema.org/&gt; . @prefix data: &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/&gt; . @prefix cc: &lt;http://creativecommons.org/ns#&gt; . @prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; .</pre>

<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>So until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata#Phase_3" target="_blank" rel="external">Phase III</a> there are still some usable options to explore Wikidata for research purposes. However we can still dream of future robust query system. In that dream I like to think of a query system capable of answering “does there exists is a sequence of properties that connects these two Wikidata items?”</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In my early software education, I’d been taught about how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25" target="_blank" rel="external">untested  software could result in deadly radiation-therapy machines.</a> But since I never planned to be in the medical devices industry, these sort of warnings didn’t apply to me - after all I was only writing Wikipedia bots. But this week I was proved wrong when another Wikipedian messaged me with a query unlike any I’d received before (empahsis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Max, I’ve pinged you a couple of times, but in case you’re not getting them, would you mind commenting?</p>
<p>It’s about an edit your bot made to Wikidata that changed the infobox of a featured article about a book about the Holocaust, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_%28book%29" title="Night (book)" target="_blank" rel="external">Night</a>. The bot fetched data from the Italian Wikipedia, rather than from the English (the book is in English) or the French (it was first published in France).</p>
<p>The issue is that the Italian Wikipedia calls it fiction (a novel), rather than memoir. This is an issue because Holocaust deniers call it fiction too, so we’ve avoided doing the same. It’s not that only Holcaust deniers call it that (it is memoir, but parts appear to have been fictionalized, so “novel” is not a horrible genre for it), but there is sensitivity around it because of them, and the author doesn’t like it to be called a novel.</p>
<p>I’m trying to find out why your bot would have fetched the data from the Italian Wikipedia. Any light you can shed on it would be appreciated. Best wishes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SlimVirgin" title="User:SlimVirgin" target="_blank" rel="external">SarahSV</a> <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SlimVirgin" title="User talk:SlimVirgin" target="_blank" rel="external">(talk)</a></small> 02:12, 29 April 2016 (UTC)<br>The truth is that this was an honest mistake because my intention, in line with the philosophical underpinnings of Wikidata is to avoid this sort of cross-cultural conflict. Wikidata has a pluralist ideology, that is it can support many competing facts without favouring any one. It allows you to say that the book Night is: a novel (according to these historians), and separately an autobiography (according to some other source). My intention was to use this pluralist structure, with the sources being Italian and English Wikipedias, but a bug in my code prevented that ideal.  (By the way I believe the Holocaust did happen, <a href="http://notconfusing.com/kleins-search-for-klajnbohms-an-ancestral-research-trip-to-zwolen-poland/" target="_blank" rel="external">read about my ancestral trip to Poland to find out more</a>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, the technical issue was that I missed an ‘else’ case because of a poor programming design. In some cases just the first Wikipedia languages I was inspecting would be represented in Wikidata. I was utilizing English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Polish, Swedish Wikipedias, in no particular order, and in this case Italian went first, and only it’s opinion about the genre of Night, was carried into Wikidata.</p>
<p>I now feel and understand empirically why testing so is crucial. It’s no longer and abstract, academic curiosity backed up thinly by seemingly unrelated horror stories. Thank you life for teaching me this lesson. And perhaps, as my colleagues have commented, the way algorithms - and all their shortcomings - shape history, is a rich venue for research.</p>
<p>Interested programmers may read on for details of the bug. <a href="https://gist.github.com/notconfusing/0dfed7e9bea694ecb476c1cc7b4b2d88#file-viafbot-infobox-book-L418" target="_blank" rel="external">Looking at my old code</a>, I find a comment describing the states I was looking for between the localClaims (scraped from various Wikipedias) and the remoteClaims (already existing in Wikidata). I wrote:</p>
<p><pre>‘’’there are three states:<br>noMatchingClaim, so we add our claim<br>matchingClaimUnsourced, so we add our source<br>matchingClaimSourced, claim was already present and had the same source, do nothing’’’<br></pre><br>Then I proceed to try and find these states by writing what is a basically a big decision tree. So big that it’s a text-wrap nightmare, 8 blocks deep.<br><small></small></p>
<p><pre>noMatchingClaim = False<br>matchingClaimUnsourced = False<br>matchingClaimSourced = False</pre></p>
<p>for remoteClaimList in remoteClaims.itervalues():<br>    for remoteClaim in remoteClaimList:<br>        if localClaim.id == remoteClaim.id:<br>            if localClaim.getTarget() == remoteClaim.getTarget():</p>
<pre><code>#now we see if a our source is there
for remoteSourceDict in remoteClaim.getSources():
    for remoteSourceList in remoteSourceDict.itervalues():
        for remoteSource in remoteSourceList:
            if remoteSource.id == localSource.id:
                if remoteSource.getTarget() == localSource.getTarget():
                    matchingClaimSourced = True
if not matchingClaimSourced:
    matchingClaimUnsourced = remoteClaim
</code></pre><p><br>Very unfortunately I missed about what to do if we have a <em>matching claim with a conflicting value</em>, it should be have been recorded as noMatchingClaim, but I overlooked it because of the heavily nested structure. To fix this I think flat, and functional would have been better. And of course, some testing wouldn’t have gone amiss either.</p>
<p>Trying to be more, not confusing.</p>

<li>The modern consumer elects to understand arbitrary differences in item-classes.</li>
<li>The corporation co-opts leisure time of the individual to construct an aesthetic.</li>
<li>Even if thebeers are not that different, they will say they are.</li>
<li>This is similar to the divided political “spectrum”, that is, not a spectrum at all.</li>
<li>As a test case take the IPA, the least versatile “acquired” taste.</li>
<li>Once the consumer has developed a false consciousness and accepts  the objectionable and anti-rational quality of IPA ethanol, that consumer has joined the in-group.<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/jdpx5.jpg" alt=""></li>
<li>They are alienated from the fruits of your tastebuds.</li>
<li>Drinking at breweries is an activity built around spending money to learn distinctions between products. That is a commercialism of experience and product.</li>
<li>The cooperatively owned brewery, addresses worker exploitation, and no more.</li>
<li>Flavours of ethanol remain not that different.</li>

        <p>I first discovered Why? in the same way that all new music came to me in my teenage years, pen-pal-ship with my best friend Daniel Cohen. I’d wanted to retain my friends and life when I was stripped from England in ‘99, and between annual visits, emails filled in the gaps for us. (In retrospect this comments on the history of chat technology, youngsters able to figure it out around the millennium.) An early symbol of my empathetic practice, in 2004 electro-mails I basically asked Dan questions that Pitchfork media was answering. I’m not taking credit for his current success as a reviewing journalist, but I think he relished the task and I gave him plenty of practice.</p>
<p>This era also marked birth of Garage Band, and I would apply for transatlantic feedback on homemade mp3 which were admittedly variable. Always graciously, he would come back with what went right - a bassline, or a beat - and what to improve on - the melody, the structure, or too much repetition. What a tireless sounding board he was. Fatefully he once sent me the track “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oCWduKu9nk" target="_blank" rel="external">3am by Young Jeezy prod. Timbaland.</a>“ along with a break down on the innovative percussive mouth sounds, and the room it had to breathe, the elements that made it pop with contrast. His adulation made me revere this track as a gold standard, and so Dan’s unqualified approval of my music became my aim.</p>
<p>You can trust his opinion because of his dedication to surveying the complete musical landscape. Dan told me about the several spellings of his name that could be used as a different mindsets to approach listening. There was “D-Co” reserved for the Brooklynesque B-boy lifestyle; “Deeko,” a UK-funky hypebeast, and “dico,” the minimal, experimental Berlin producer.  (I’m probably getting these wrong, but as I will explain later, the memory faults are an intentional part of this series). This level of pan-genricism impressed me deeply. The more Dan spread his taste the more sage and trustworthy his direction was.</p>
<p>I hung to the album names that he would drop. There was <em>Music Has the Right to Children</em>, <em>Ege Bamyasi</em>, and <em>Dungen</em>. Each one felt like a special insight into the the infinite maze of all the possible music there was to listen to. There was also <em>Alopecia</em> which confirmed a suspicion I had about the size of the infinity that that Maze was. It was growing exponentially, and some of the corners of strange cul-de-sacs were going to contain the gems.</p>
<p>It’s true that I had a predisposition to like the the music that Dan introduced me to because of the intertwining of my need for friendship. But if that told the whole story, I couldn’t exceed his appreciation of the media. Mother’s can give birth to children more talented than they are in areas. The same is true for my love for Dan, and my obsession with Why?</p>

        <p>I have typically avoided the realm of UI design, as I view as fraught with of cults of personalities and nonstop bikeshedding, but this semester I decided to try my hand and find seperate the theory from the style posing as theory. The course I am taking is centered around a large project to design an application that helps a population of people with a need they have. This coincides nicely with a dream I have harbored to make technology for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doula" target="_blank" rel="external">doulas</a>- providers of nonmedical, practical and emotional support for pregnancy.  My partner is a doula and leader in a doula organization, so I have been somewhat privy to the way they use tech to run their program. What should come as a shock to no one, is that there do not exist any applications that are tailored for their kind of work.</p>
<p>If there is one main thesis coming out of UI Design theory today, its that it ought to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design" target="_blank" rel="external">user-centered</a>. That is, the design should suit the needs and expectations of the users, not the programmers making it. In this vein, the only way to start our project (I am working in a group of 4 other students), was to get some input from birth workers.</p>
<p>With the help of my partner, we sent out a request to some list-serves about what doulas think are technical debts opportunities at the moment. In fact we received a very quick response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><div>I’ve been thinking about an app for black pregnant women; that would connect them with doulas and resources. I don’t know if that’s what you had in mind though since you mention care providers rather than the women themselves. There is a huge gap in info for black women who are interested in alternative birth.</div></p>
<p><div></div><br>It was fantastic to get such a clear signal for a need for such an important and undeserved population. It really excited me having a direct request to make an app for black pregnant women, and I followed up with the requester of the idea. But after some consideration I felt that it might be irresponsible to take on the assignment. The reasoning was that, although I am very dedicated to the idea, because I am doing it for class, there is a distinct possibility of the end product not being very polished in the short-term. In addition, the design process requires time and input from the users for prototyping etc. If we didn’t end up making an app that was very useful for black pregnant women we would in essence be using black pregnant women to get “A” in a class. That seemed like a very perverse backfiring of good intentions and privileged people misappropriating the efforts of less privileged people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We put out more calls, and eventually made contact with another doula organization that was willing to work with us, with explicit disclosure of all the risk and time involved in taking on designing a tech project. In fact a partner of one of the doulas is a computer science student like ourselves. This is the basis for what makes working with doulas organizations potentially less dangerous than black pregnant women. I believe that work for social good with people that aren’t like myself should come in the form of strong partnership and allyship. In this case my closeness to my girlfriend’s* connection to doula work allows me to be a closer partner in making tech for doulas than black pregnant women, of which I know none at the moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Using the term “girlfriend” to distinguish between “partner” in the make-a-family-together sense and “partner” in the make-technology-together sense)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have commenced work with a doula organization which I will not name out of privacy concerns. As per UI design protocols our first step was to conduct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry" target="_blank" rel="external">contextual inquiries</a> with our potential user base. A contextual inquiry is  an inspection of the practices of the user, what is important to them and what are pain points they experience in their work. The advised approach is one where the designers are “apprentice” and the users are the “masters”. This mindset tries to stop designers preconceiving of what the user will want.</p>
<p>One of our inquiries was with the leaders of a doula organization which focuses on support for birth, and the other which focuses on support for abortion. In fact finding the overlap and underlap in the needs of these two user bases was fascinating, and have many design implications. In terms of <strong>similarities</strong>, we found needs in anonymity in client-doula matching.</p>
<h3 id="Anonymity"><a href="#Anonymity" class="headerlink" title="Anonymity"></a>Anonymity</h3><p>The role of the organizations are to connect together clients and doulas. With birth, and particularly abortion, keeping the everyone’s identities anonymous until a match is made is crucial. At the moment, a leader of the doula organization will collect requests from clients, anonymize them, and then advertise the requests to doulas. Doulas that would like to work with the client are then relayed back to through the organizer. Once the client accepts the match, only then are identities and contact information exchanged. Certainly we can automate part of this workflow to assist a leader in matching: automatically stripping out names and contacting doulas, autoshuttling these responses back.</p>
<p>An open question that takes this a step further is if the matching can be done <em>anonymously without a centralized</em> connector of the two sides.</p>
<h3 id="Platform"><a href="#Platform" class="headerlink" title="Platform"></a>Platform</h3><p>Of course the designs above are similar to other online systems that assume the use of email. For people that are looking for a doula in these contexts - not to mention the expense of healthcare in the United States - email or web access is not guaranteed. In fact in the contextual inquiries we found that the most common form of communication was the plain old telephone. This means that interaction through text-messaging, or touch-tone phone systems would be required for full automation on the client side. Luckily on the doula-facing side emailing is much more standard, which makes solving the problem partially through more standard means more tractable.</p>
<p>Still the <strong>differences</strong> between birth work and abortion work surfaces even more hard to see design implications.</p>
<h3 id="Choice-vs-Speed"><a href="#Choice-vs-Speed" class="headerlink" title="Choice vs. Speed"></a>Choice vs. Speed</h3><p>One junction in matching is sending the client back their potential doula matches. In birth work, we found that this organization likes to emphasize _choice _for the client as way to empower the client. That means that the organizer will wait an amount of time for many doulas to respond to client request so that they can relay several choices back. On the other hand we heard from abortion workers that <em>speed</em> is most important in matching, due to abortion options being more time-sensitive. In this case the first doula responding is returned to the client. Any system trying to accommodate these needs will have to use varying mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="Follow-up"><a href="#Follow-up" class="headerlink" title="Follow up"></a><strong>Follow</strong> up</h3><p>Famously, facebook has been criticized for their “memory” sharing because it can bring up aggravating memories of a break-up or other hard times. As we heard, in the case of abortion work, following up with a client can also painfully and accidentally remind a client of their abortion. However in birth work scheduled follow-ups with clients are standard practice. Therefore a system should be extremely sensitive about when, and to whom, the system will send messages. For instance, maybe even in the case of say a password expiration it would be better not to e-mail/text the client from the system, but to perform an alternative internal action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some of the observations that we have have made so far. We still have prototyping and building phases to complete. I believe the design of doula organization tech is valuable and unexplored territory in UI design, and valuable for feminist HCI (human computer interaction).</p>
